Knowledge of whether personality is heritable, and to what degree it is influenced by the social environment, is crucial to understanding its evolutionary significance, yet few estimates are available from natural populations. We tracked three behavioural traits during different life-history stages in a pedigreed population of wild house sparrows. Using a quantitative genetic approach, we demonstrated heritability in adult exploration, and in nestling activity after accounting for fixed effects, but not in adult boldness. We did not detect maternal effects on any traits, but we did detect a social brood effect on nestling activity. Boldness, exploration and nestling activity in this population did not form a behavioural syndrome, suggesting that selection could act independently on these behavioural traits in this species, although we found no consistent support for phenotypic selection on these traits. Our work shows that repeatable behaviours can vary in their heritability and that social context influences personality traits. Future efforts could separate whether personality traits differ in heritability because they have served specific functional roles in the evolution of the phenotype or because our concept of personality and the stability of behaviour needs to be revised.",repeatable behaviors can vary in their heritability and brood effects influence personality traits. ,Passer domesticus,house sparrows,Aves,tracked behaviors in wild sparrows,pedigree,no maternal effects detected,Maybe,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

For obvious ethical reasons, the same level of experimental control is not possible in human populations. Nonetheless, there are natural experimental designs in human populations that can serve as logical extensions of the rigorous quantitative genetic experimental designs used by animal and plant researchers. Applying concepts such as cross-fostering and common garden rearing approaches from the life science discipline, we describe human designs that can serve as naturalistic proxies for the controlled quantitative genetic experiments facilitated in life sciences research. We present the prevention relevance of three such human designs: (1) children adopted at birth by parents to whom they are not genetically related (common garden approach); (2) sibling designs where one sibling is reared from birth with unrelated adoptive parents and the other sibling is reared from birth by the biological mother of the sibling pair (cross-fostering approach); and (3) in vitro fertilization designs, including egg donation, sperm donation, embryo donation, and surrogacy (prenatal cross-fostering approach). Each of these designs allows for differentiation of the effects of the prenatal and/or postnatal rearing environment from effects of genes shared between parent and child in naturalistic ways that can inform prevention efforts. Example findings from each design type are provided and conclusions drawn about the relevance of naturalistic genetic designs to prevention science.",describe different 'natural experimental designs' for human populations (analogs of common gardens and cross-fostering) to be used in prevention,humans,,,use existing data,,worth looking at to see what types of behaviors they study,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

The evolution of competitive ability, in particular social dominance, depends on genetic (co)variation among traits causal (e.g., behavior) or consequent (e.g., growth) to competitive outcomes. If dominance is heritable, it will generate both direct and indirect genetic effects (IGE) on resource-dependent traits. The latter are expected to impose evolutionary constraint because winners necessarily gain resources at the expense of losers. We varied competition in a population of sheepshead swordtails, Xiphophorus birchmanni, to investigate effects on behavior, size, growth, and survival. We then applied quantitative genetic analyses to determine (i) whether competition leads to phenotypic and/or genetic integration of behavior with life history and (ii) the potential for IGE to constrain life history evolution. Size, growth, and survival were reduced at high competition. Male dominance was repeatable and dominant individuals show higher growth and survival. Additive genetic contributions to phenotypic covariance were significant, with the G matrix largely recapitulating phenotypic relationships. Social dominance has a low but significant heritability and is strongly genetically correlated with size and growth.

The Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) is a collection of 205 inbred strains with whole genome sequences derived from a single wild population in Raleigh, NC, USA. The large amount of quantitative genetic variation, lack of population structure, and rapid local decay of linkage disequilibrium in the DGRP and outbred populations derived from DGRP lines present a favorable scenario for performing genome-wide association (GWA) mapping analyses to identify candidate causal genes, polymorphisms, and pathways affecting quantitative traits. The many GWA studies utilizing the DGRP have revealed substantial natural genetic variation for all reported traits, little evidence for variants with large effects but enrichment for variants with low P-values, and a tendency for lower frequency variants to have larger effects than more common variants. The variants detected in the GWA analyses rarely overlap those discovered using mutagenesis, and often are the first functional annotations of computationally predicted genes. Variants implicated in GWA analyses typically have sex-specific and genetic background-specific (epistatic) effects, as well as pleiotropic effects on other quantitative traits.

Vander Wal, Eric", An evolutionary framework outlining the integration of individual social   and spatial ecology,87,2018," 1. Behaviour is the interface between an organism and its environment, and behavioural plasticity is important for organisms to cope with environmental change. Social behaviour is particularly important because sociality is a dynamic process, where environmental variation influences group dynamics and social plasticity can mediate resource acquisition. Heterogeneity in the ecological environment can therefore influence the social environment. The combination of the ecological and social environments may be interpreted collectively as the socioecological environment, which could explain variation in fitness.   2. Our objective was to outline a framework through which individual social and spatial phenotypes can be integrated and interpreted as phenotypes that covary as a function of changes in the socioecological environment. We propose the socioecological environment is composed of individual behavioural traits, including sociality and habitat selection, both of which are repeatable, potentially heritable and may reflect animal personality traits. We also highlight how ecological and social niche theory can be applied to the socioecological environment framework, where individuals occupy different socioecological niches. Individual sociality and habitat selection are also density-dependent, and theory predicts that density-dependent traits should affect reproduction, survival, and therefore fitness and population dynamics.   3. We then illustrate the proximate links between sociality, habitat selection and fitness as well as the ultimate, and possibly adaptive, consequences associated with changes in population density. The ecological, evolutionary and applied implications of our proposed socioecological environment framework are broad and changes in density could influence individual fitness and population dynamics. For instance, human-induced environmental changes can influence population density, which can affect the distribution of social and spatial phenotypes within a population. In summary, we outline a conceptual framework that incorporates individual social and spatial behavioural traits with fitness and we highlight a range of ecological and evolutionary processes that are likely associated with the socioecological environment.","socioecological environment is composed of individual behavioral traits which are heritable and influence personality.

G."," Social traits, social networks and evolutionary biology",30,2017," The social environment is both an important agent of selection for most organisms, and an emergent property of their interactions. As an aggregation of interactions among members of a population, the social environment is a product of many sets of relationships and so can be represented as a network or matrix. Social network analysis in animals has focused on why these networks possess the structure they do, and whether individuals' network traits, representing some aspect of their social phenotype, relate to their fitness. Meanwhile, quantitative geneticists have demonstrated that traits expressed in a social context can depend on the phenotypes and genotypes of interacting partners, leading to influences of the social environment on the traits and fitness of individuals and the evolutionary trajectories of populations. Therefore, both fields are investigating similar topics, yet have arrived at these points relatively independently. We review how these approaches are diverged, and yet how they retain clear parallelism and so strong potential for complementarity. This demonstrates that, despite separate bodies of theory, advances in one might inform the other. Techniques in network analysis for quantifying social phenotypes, and for identifying community structure, should be useful for those studying the relationship between individual behaviour and group-level phenotypes. Entering social association matrices into quantitative genetic models may also reduce bias in heritability estimates, and allow the estimation of the influence of social connectedness on trait expression. Current methods for measuring natural selection in a social context explicitly account for the fact that a trait is not necessarily the property of a single individual, something the network approaches have not yet considered when relating network metrics to individual fitness. Harnessing evolutionary models that consider traits affected by genes in other individuals (i.e. indirect genetic effects) provides the potential to understand how entire networks of social interactions in populations influence phenotypes and predict how these traits may evolve. By theoretical integration of social network analysis and quantitative genetics, we hope to identify areas of compatibility and incompatibility and to direct research efforts towards the most promising areas. Continuing this synthesis could provide important insights into the evolution of traits expressed in a social context and the evolutionary consequences of complex and nuanced social phenotypes.",social network analysis and quantitative geneticists have converged based on the context dependent expression of traits.

Brommer, Jon E.", A statistical methodology for estimating assortative mating for   phenotypic traits that are labile or measured with error,8,2017," Assortative mating in wild populations is commonly reported as the correlation between males' and females' phenotypes across mated pairs. Theories of partner selection and quantitative genetics assume that phenotypic resemblance of partners captures associations in intrinsically determined trait values. However, when considering traits with a repeatability below one (labile traits or traits measured with error), the correlation between phenotypes of paired individuals can arise from shared environmental effects on the phenotypes of paired individuals or correlated measurement error. We introduce statistical approaches to estimate assortative mating in labile traits or traits measured with error in the presence of shared environmental effects. These approaches include (1) the correlation between the mean phenotypes of males and females, (2) the correlation between randomized values of individuals and (3) the between-pair correlation derived from a bivariate mixed model. We use simulations to show that the performance of these different approaches depends on the number of repeated measures within individuals or pairs, which is determined by study design, and rates of survival and divorce. We conclude that short-term environmental effects on phenotypes of paired individuals likely inflate estimates of assortative mating when not statistically accounted for. Our approach allows investigation of this important issue in assortative mating studies for labile traits (e.g. behaviour, physiology, or metabolism) in both socially monogamous and other mating systems, and groupings of individuals outside a mating context.",Statistical approaches to estimate assortative mating in labile traits in the presence of shared environmental effects. ,,,,stats method,,possibly not useful for the chapter,No,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Ragland, Gregory J.", Genetic Decoupling of Thermal Hardiness across Metamorphosis in   Drosophila melanogaster,57,2017," As organisms age the environment fluctuates, exerting differential selection across ontogeny. In particular, highly seasonal environments expose life stages to often drastically different thermal environments. This developmental variation is particularly striking in organisms with complex life cycles, wherein life history stages also exhibit distinct morphologies, physiologies, and behaviors. Genes acting pleiotropically on thermal responses may produce genetic correlations across ontogeny, constraining the independent evolution of each life stage to their respective thermal environments. To investigate whether developmental genetic correlations constrain the evolution thermal hardiness of the fly Drosophila melanogaster, we applied quantitative genetic analyses to cold hardiness measured in both larvae and adults from isogenic lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), using survival at stressful low temperatures as the phenotypic metric. Using full genome resequencing data for the DGRP, we also implemented genome-wide association (GWA) analysis using Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Models (BSLMMs) to estimate associations between naturally segregating variation and cold hardiness for both larvae and adults. Quantitative genetic analyses revealed no significant genetic correlation for cold hardiness between life stages, suggesting complete genetic decoupling of thermal hardiness across the metamorphic boundary. Both quantitative genetic and GWA analyses suggested that polygenic variation underlies cold hardiness in both stages, and that associated loci largely affected one stage or the other, but not both. However, reciprocal enrichment tests and correlations between BSLMM parameters for each life stage support some shared physiological mechanisms that may reflect common cellular thermal response pathways. Overall, these results suggest no developmental genetic constraints on cold hardiness across metamorphosis in D. melanogaster, an important consideration in evolutionary models of responses to changing climates. Genetic correlations for environmental sensitivity across ontogeny remains largely unexplored in other organisms, thus assessing the generality of genetic decoupling will require further quantitative or population genetic analysis in additional species.",developmental genetic correlations and evolution of thermal hardiness.

Dingemanse, Niels J.", Sex-dependent expression of behavioural genetic architectures and the   evolution of sexual dimorphism,284,2017," Empirical studies imply that sex-specific genetic architectures can resolve evolutionary conflicts between males and females, and thereby facilitate the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Sex-specificity of behavioural genetic architectures has, however, rarely been considered. Moreover, as the expression of genetic (co) variances is often environment-dependent, general inferences on sex-specific genetic architectures require estimates of quantitative genetics parameters under multiple conditions. We measured exploration and aggression in pedigreed populations of southern field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) raised on either naturally balanced (free-choice) or imbalanced (protein-deprived) diets. For each dietary condition, we measured for each behavioural trait (i) level of sexual dimorphism, (ii) level of sex-specificity of survival selection gradients, (iii) level of sex-specificity of additive genetic variance, and (iv) strength of the cross-sex genetic correlation. We report here evidence for sexual dimorphism in behaviour as well as sex-specificity in the expression of genetic (co) variances as predicted by theory. The additive genetic variances of exploration and aggression were significantly greater in males compared with females. Cross-sex genetic correlations were highly positive for exploration but deviating (significantly) from one for aggression; findings were consistent across dietary treatments. This suggests that genetic architectures characterize the sexually dimorphic focal behaviours across various key environmental conditions in the wild. Our finding also highlights that sexual conflict can be resolved by evolving sexually independent genetic architectures.",measured exploration and aggression in different dietary environments and found sex-specificity in the expression of genetic (co) variances as predicted by theory. variances were higher in males compared with females. sexual conflict can be resolved by evolving sexually independent genetic architectures ,Gryllus bimaculatus,Mediterranean field cricket,Insecta,quantiative genetics study on  manipulated diets,pedigree,great example,Yes,,,,,,x,,,,,x,,,,,,,not human
 J, INTERFACE FOCUS," Sultan, SEAF Sultan, Sonia E.", Developmental plasticity: re-conceiving the genotype,7,2017," In recent decades, the phenotype of an organism (i.e. its traits and behaviour) has been studied as the outcome of a developmental 'programme' coded in its genotype. This deterministic view is implicit in the Modern Synthesis approach to adaptive evolution as a sorting process among genetic variants. Studies of developmental pathways have revealed that genotypes are in fact differently expressed depending on environmental conditions. Accordingly, the genotype can be understood as a repertoire of potential developmental outcomes or norm of reaction. Reconceiving the genotype as an environmental response repertoire rather than a fixed developmental programme leads to three critical evolutionary insights. First, plastic responses to specific conditions often comprise functionally appropriate trait adjustments, resulting in an individual-level, developmental mode of adaptive variation. Second, because genotypes are differently expressed depending on the environment, the genetic diversity available to natural selection is itself environmentally contingent. Finally, environmental influences on development can extend across multiple generations via cytoplasmic and epigenetic factors transmitted to progeny individuals, altering their responses to their own, immediate environmental conditions and, in some cases, leading to inherited but non-genetic adaptations. Together, these insights suggest a more nuanced understanding of the genotype and its evolutionary role, as well as a shift in research focus to investigating the complex developmental interactions among genotypes, environments and previous environments.","consider the genotype as a repertoire of potential developmental outcomes (a reaction norm). genetic diversity available to natural selection is environmentally contingent, and environmental influences on development can extend across multiple generations via epigenetic factors.

Broadly speaking, two main research strategies explore genetic and environmental influences on happiness, including quantitative and molecular genetics. Whereas molecular genetics seeks to trace the causal pathways from specific DNA variants, quantitative genetics estimates the magnitude of overall genetic and environmental influences without specifying actual DNA sequences and usually without specifying specific environmental circumstances. Molecular genetic studies have entered the happiness arena, but have shown mixed results. Most replicated findings are therefore based on quantitative genetics and derived from twin and family studies decomposing variation and co-variation into genetic, shared, and non-shared environmental sources. Recent meta-analyses of such studies report genetic influences (i.e., heritability) to account for 32-40 % of the variation in overall happiness (i.e., SWB, LS), and indicate that heritability varies across populations, subgroups, contexts and/or constructs. When exploring stable SWB levels, heritability is reported in the 70-80 % range, whereas momentary positive affect is often entirely situational. Happiness is thus heritable, stable, variable and changeable. What do these findings imply? Can happiness be raised as a platform in individuals and societies? We suggest that individual and societal interventions that target causal pathways and address both amplifying and compensatory processes (i.e., focus on developing strengths and mitigating risks)-thus providing for positive gene-environment matchmaking, are likely to be effective and longer lasting.","behavioral genetics of happiness summarized - comparing molecular genetics and quantitative genetics.

We quantified the degree of prezygotic isolation and geographical variation in mating behaviour among four populations of Sepsis neocynipsea that occur in allopatry, parapatry or sympatry with four populations of its sister species Sepsis cynipsea. To obtain insights into the quantitative genetic basis and the role of selection against hybrid phenotypes we also investigated mating behaviour of F-1 hybrid offspring and corresponding backcrosses with the parental populations. Our study documents successful hybridization under laboratory conditions, with low copulation frequencies in heterospecific pairings but higher frequencies in pairings of F-1 hybrids signifying hybrid vigour. Analyses of F-1 offspring and their parental backcrosses provided little evidence for sexual selection against hybrids. Longer copulation latencies in heterospecific pairings indicate species recognition, probably due to surface or volatile chemicals. The frequency of male mating attempts did not differ greatly between species or hybrid pairings, suggesting no male discrimination of mating partners. Female shaking duration, signifying female choice and/or reluctance to mate, differed strongly between the species and appears to contribute to avoiding heterospecific males; this trait is partially maternal inherited. Importantly, females of both species discriminated more strongly against males in areas of sympatry than allopatry indicating reinforcement. Shorter copulations in heterospecific parental pairings and longer copulations in F-1 hybrids suggest mechanistic difficulties with sperm transfer. Overall, our study highlights an important role of character displacement affecting mating behaviour of hybridizing sepsid species in geographical areas of coexistence.

P.   van Noordwijk, Arie J.", Consequences of the genetic threshold model for observing partial   migration under climate change scenarios,7,2017," Migration is a widespread phenomenon across the animal kingdom as a response to seasonality in environmental conditions. Partially migratory populations are populations that consist of both migratory and residential individuals. Such populations are very common, yet their stability has long been debated. The inheritance of migratory activity is currently best described by the threshold model of quantitative genetics. The inclusion of such a genetic threshold model for migratory behavior leads to a stable zone in time and space of partially migratory populations under a wide range of demographic parameter values, when assuming stable environmental conditions and unlimited genetic diversity. Migratory species are expected to be particularly sensitive to global warming, as arrival at the breeding grounds might be increasingly mistimed as a result of the uncoupling of long-used cues and actual environmental conditions, with decreasing reproduction as a consequence. Here, we investigate the consequences for migratory behavior and the stability of partially migratory populations under five climate change scenarios and the assumption of a genetic threshold value for migratory behavior in an individual-based model. The results show a spatially and temporally stable zone of partially migratory populations after different lengths of time in all scenarios. In the scenarios in which the species expands its range from a particular set of starting populations, the genetic diversity and location at initialization determine the species' colonization speed across the zone of partial migration and therefore across the entire landscape. Abruptly changing environmental conditions after model initialization never caused a qualitative change in phenotype distributions, or complete extinction. This suggests that climate change-induced shifts in species' ranges as well as changes in survival probabilities and reproductive success can be met with flexibility in migratory behavior at the species level, which will reduce the risk of extinction.",Inheritance of migratory activity using threshold model of quantitative genetics. ,,,,individual-based simulation model,,look into the threshold model - what is it?,Maybe,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY," Van Cleve, JAF Van Cleve, Jeremy"," Stags, Hawks, and Doves: Social Evolution Theory and Individual   Variation in Cooperation",57,2017," One of the triumphs of evolutionary biology is the discovery of robust mechanisms that promote the evolution of cooperative behaviors even when cooperation reduces the fertility or survival of cooperators. These mechanisms include, kin selection, reciprocity, and direct benefits to cooperation that are often nonlinear. Though they have been extensively studied separately, investigating the joint action of these mechanisms has been more difficult. Moreover, how these mechanisms shape variation in cooperation is not well known. Such variation is crucial for understanding the evolution of behavioral syndromes and animal personality. Here, I use the tools of kin selection and evolutionary game theory to build a framework that integrates these mechanisms for pairwise social interactions. Using relatedness as a measure of the strength of kin selection, responsiveness as a measure of reciprocity, and synergy as a measure of payoff nonlinearity, I show how different combinations of these three parameters produce directional selection for or against cooperation or variation in levels of cooperation via stabilizing or diversifying selection. Moreover, each of these outcomes maps uniquely to one of four classic games from evolutionary game theory, which means that modulating relatedness, responsiveness, and synergy effectively transforms the payoff matrix from one the evolutionary game to another. Assuming that cooperation exacts a fertility cost on cooperators and provides a fertility benefit to social partners, a prisoner's dilemma game and directional selection against cooperation occur when relatedness and responsiveness are low and synergy is not too positive. Enough positive synergy in these conditions generates a stag-hunt game and diversifying selection. High levels of relatedness or responsiveness turn cooperation from a fitness cost into a fitness benefit, which produces a mutualism game and directional selection for cooperation when synergy is not too negative. Sufficiently negative synergy in this case creates a hawk-dove game and stabilizing selection for cooperation. I extend the results with relatedness and synergy to social groups and show that how group size changes the effect of relatedness and synergy on selection for cooperation depends on how the per capita benefit of cooperation changes with group size. Together, these results provide a general framework with which to generate comparative predictions that can be tested using quantitative genetic techniques and experimental techniques that manipulate investment in cooperation. These predictions will help us understand both interspecific variation in cooperation as well as within-population and within-group variation in cooperation related to behavioral syndromes.","game theoretical approach to understanding cooperation using relatedness, reciprocity, and synergy payoffs, setting up a framework that could be tested with quantitative genetics",,,,game theoretic model,,Probably not very useful,No,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,not human

An international workshop ""Genetics and Development of Cooperation,"" organized by the University of Bern (Switzerland), aimed at discussing the current progress in this research field and suggesting avenues for future research. This review uses the major themes of the meeting as a springboard to synthesize the concepts of genetic and nongenetic inheritance of cooperation, and to review a quantitative genetic framework that allows for the inclusion of indirect genetic effects. Furthermore, we argue that including nongenetic inheritance, such as transgenerational epigenetic effects, parental effects, ecological and cultural inheritance, provides a more nuanced view of the evolution of cooperation. We summarize those genes and molecular pathways in a range of species that seem promising candidates for mechanisms underlying cooperative behaviours. Concerning the neurobiological substrate of cooperation, we suggest three cognitive skills necessary for the ability to cooperate: (i) event memory, (ii) synchrony with others and (iii) responsiveness to others.

Finally, we provide recommendations for which biological systems and species may be particularly suitable, which specific traits and parameters should be measured, what type of approaches should be followed, and which methods should be employed in studies of cooperation to better understand how cooperation evolves and manifests in nature.","review/synthesis of genetic and nongenetic inheritance of cooperation, and a review o a quantitative genetic framework that allows for the inclusion of indirect genetic effects",,,,summary and synthesis,,read for the nongenetic inheritance part,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,not human

Females developing in close proximity to males show behavioral, physiological and life history characteristics that are masculinized. With the exception of one inconclusive study, nothing is known of the genetic basis of this phenomenon. In this paper, we reported an analysis of the quantitative genetic basis of masculinization, as indicated by the anogenital distance (AGD) at birth and weaning, in the rodent Octodon degus. Because AGD is related to weight, we included a genetic analysis of pup weight at birth and weaning. Pairwise correlations showed that AGD at birth varied negatively with litter size and parturition number but positively with weaning AGD, birth weight, dam AGD and percentage of males in the litter. AGD at weaning varied similarly except that it tended to vary positively with litter size. Genetic (co) variances of AGD at birth and weight at birth differed in females and males. In females, the best genetic model included substantial effects of direct additive, additive maternal and a negative additive genetic covariance between these two. In males, variances were small and there was difficulty in discriminating between additive maternal and common environmental variances.

Dingemanse, Niels J.", Indirect genetic effects: a key component of the genetic architecture of   behaviour,7,2017," Behavioural ecology research increasingly focuses on why genetic behavioural variation can persist despite selection. Evolutionary theory predicts that directional selection leads to evolutionary change while depleting standing genetic variation. Nevertheless, evolutionary stasis may occur for traits involved in social interactions. This requires tight negative genetic correlations between direct genetic effects (DGEs) of an individual's genes on its own phenotype and the indirect genetic effects (IGEs) it has on conspecifics, as this could diminish the amount of genetic variation available to selection to act upon. We tested this prediction using a pedigreed laboratory population of Mediterranean field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus), in which both exploratory tendency and aggression are heritable. We found that genotypes predisposed to be aggressive (due to DGEs) strongly decreased aggressiveness in opponents (due to IGEs). As a consequence, the variance in total breeding values was reduced to almost zero, implying that IGEs indeed greatly contribute to the occurrence of evolutionary stasis. IGEs were further associated with genetic variation in a non-social behaviour: explorative genotypes elicited most aggression in opponents. These key findings imply that IGEs indeed represent an important overlooked mechanism that can impact evolutionary dynamics of traits under selection.",test hypothesis that tight negative genetic correlations between direct genetic effects and indirect genetic effects on conspecifics could diminish variation.

Reference genes, which are often referred to as housekeeping genes, such as GAPDH, G3PDH, EF2, RpL7A, RpL10, TUB alpha and Actin, have traditionally been assumed to be stably expressed in all conditions, and they are frequently used to normalize mRNA levels between different samples in qPCR analysis. However, it is known that the expression of these genes is influenced by numerous factors, such as experimental conditions. The difference in gene expression underlies a range of biological processes, including development, reproduction and behavior. The aim of this study was to show the problems associated with using reference genes in the qPCR technique, in a study on inbred strains of Spodoptera exigua selected toward cadmium resistance. We present and discuss our results and observations, and give some recommendations concerning the use and limitations of housekeeping genes as internal standards, especially in research on insects. Our results suggest that holometabolism and poikilothermia, as well as time since metamorphosis and the level of exposure to the selective factor (cadmium in this case), have a significant effect on the expression of reference genes.",find that holometabolism and poikilothermia impact expression of reference genes. not relevant,Spodoptera exigua,beet armyworm,Insecta,tested gene expression with qPCR,,not very useful,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Population geneticists used to think, following Sewall Wright, that mean relative fitness, W, would be maximized by natural selection"" (Felsenstein 2000). The present paper describes the genesis, diffusion and fall of this ""obsession"", by giving a biography of the mean fitness function in population genetics. This modeling method devised by Sewall Wright in the 1930s found its heyday in the late 1950s and early 1960s, in the wake of Motoo Kimura's and Richard Lewontin's works. It seemed a reliable guide in the mathematical study of deterministic effects (the study of natural selection in populations of infinite size, with no drift), leading to powerful generalizations presenting law-like properties. Progress in population genetics theory, it then seemed, would come from the application of this method to the study of systems with several genes. This ambition came to a halt in the context of the influential objections made by the Australian mathematician Patrick Moran in 1963. These objections triggered a controversy between mathematically- and biologically-inclined geneticists, with affected both the formal standards and the aims of population genetics as a science. Over the course of the 1960s, the mean fitness method withered with the ambition of developing the deterministic theory. The mathematical theory became increasingly complex. Kimura re-focused his modeling work on the theory of random processes; as a result of his computer simulations, Lewontin became the staunchest critic of maximizing principles in evolutionary biology. The mean fitness method then migrated to other research areas, being refashioned and used in evolutionary quantitative genetics and behavioral ecology.",reviews the role of mean fitness function in pop gen and how it moved to quantitative genetics and behavioral ecology,,,,review,,could be interesting but not directly related to the chapter,Later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Byrne, Phillip G.", Body size predicts between-individual differences in exploration   behaviour in the southern corroboree frog,129,2017," Proximate mechanisms underpinning between-individual variation in repeatedly expressed behaviours (animal personality) remain poorly understood. Recent theoretical models have focused on the concept of adaptive state-dependent behaviour, proposing that repeatable differences in behaviour emerge due to individual differences in repeatable state variables such as metabolic rate, age, sex or body size. Fewstudies have attempted to investigate the effect of state on personality empirically, and evidence for links between individual variation in state and personality remains equivocal. We used a captive colony of southern corroboree frogs, Pseudophryne corroboree, to (1) test for innate, temporally repeatable behavioural differences (animal personality) along the activity, exploration/avoidance and boldness/shyness behavioural axes, (2) test for behavioural syndromes (between-individual correlations between behavioural traits) and (3) determine whether behavioural traits are correlated with body size at the between-individual level. Individuals exhibited repeatable variation along all three behavioural axes, but between-individual correlations did not deviate from zero, providing no evidence for behavioural syndromes. Body size explained 40% of the between-individual variance in exploration behaviour, with larger frogs exhibiting greater mobility and travelling further in a novel environment. These associations indicate that there is potential for innate body size variation in P. corroboree to act as an important state variable underpinning repeatable between-individual behavioural differences. Future research may test this idea experimentally. Continued investigation of state-dependent individual behaviour in P. corroboree and other animals is likely to provide important insights into the proximate causes of animal personality.

Recently, behavioral-correlations research has expanded to include correlations not only in mean-level behaviors but also in behavioral plasticity, that is, the degree to which individuals change their behavior in response to environmental stimuli. Positive correlations among behavioral plasticities would imply that individuals or genotypes that are behaviorally plastic in one way may also be plastic in other ways; negative correlations could imply trade-offs. Here, we examine aversive odor conditioning (learning) at two time points and plasticity in pupation site selection behavior across substrates in a panel of Drosophila genotypes. These behaviors represent different types of behavioral plasticity: contextual plasticity describes behavioral responses to stimuli that are currently present, while developmental plasticity describes behavioral responses to remembered experiences with stimuli in the recent past. We find that learning scores and plasticity in pupation site selection behavior are positively genetically correlated, representing the first example of a genetic correlation between developmental and contextual plasticity. These findings imply that ecological and evolutionary theories focusing on variation in a single dimension of behavioral plasticity may be incomplete.",correlations between plasticity in traits in aversive odor conditioning and in pupation site selection behavior.

Plasticity could, therefore, be maladaptive under extreme environments, unless genetic correlations are strong between extreme and non-extreme environmental states, and the optimum phenotype changes smoothly with the environment. Empirical evidence suggests that populations and species from more variable environments show higher levels of plasticity that might preadapt them to extremes, but genetic variance for plastic responses can also be low, and genetic variation may not be expressed for some classes of traits under extreme conditions. Much of the empirical literature on plastic responses to extremes has not yet been linked to ecologically relevant conditions, such as asymmetrical fluctuations in the case of temperature extremes. Nevertheless, evolved plastic responses are likely to be important for natural and agricultural species increasingly exposed to climate extremes, and there is an urgent need to collect empirical information and link this to model predictions.

However, environmental conditions may sometimes change unexpectedly. Mismatches between early and adult life, for example, can have important repercussions for adult phenotypes, potentially leading to better performance under matched than mismatched conditions as predicted by the predictive adaptive response hypothesis. We conducted a long-term experimental manipulation of dietary conditions in a population of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Broods were exposed to two early nutritional treatments until independence and we used a split-brood design to independently manipulate nutritional conditions after independence to create matched and mismatched nutritional environments in later life. Developmental trajectories of all individuals were followed for more than 5 years and we scored behavioural responses in trials in a special environment and while interacting with a special object three times during adult life. Overall, we found no evidence for early programming affecting morphology. Tarsus and wing length were exclusively influenced by the early nutrition. Body weight showed lasting effects of the early treatment and independent effects of nutritional condition during adulthood, but no effects of environmental matching or mismatching. Special-object trials showed effects of the adult nutritional treatment while environmental matching affected hopping activity in special environments. These behavioural responses showed substantial long-term individual stability over a 3-month period and were only marginally smaller when measured over a period of more than 4 years. Interestingly, survival of individuals from low-quality early nutritional condition was higher compared with highquality early condition individuals, which became evident only after years of survival monitoring. Beyond the nutritional treatment itself, we found sizable brood identity effects that slowly but steadily declined with age, indicating a significant but decaying effect of natural variation in parental provisioning on adult phenotypes.

The documented affinity of PACs for type-I collagen is directly correlated with their structural features and degree of polymerization. In this investigation, centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) was used to sequentially deplete less active monomeric and polymeric PACs from a crude Pinus massoniana bark extract to create refined mixtures enriched in oligomeric PACs. The ability of these oligomeric PACs to modify the mechanical properties of the dentin collagen matrix and their biocompatibility with dental pulp cells (DPCs) was evaluated in an innovative biomimetic environment. The refined mixtures displayed high interactivity with dentin collagen as demonstrated by a significant increase (>5-fold) in the modulus of elasticity of the dentin matrix. In a simplified model of the dentin-DPC complex, DPCs embedded within their native ECM in the presence of PAC-treated dentin exhibited increased proliferation. Quantitative gene expression analyses indicated that exposure to PAC-treated dentin increased the expression of key biomineralization and odontogenic differentiation regulators, including RUNX2, BMP2, OCN, and DSPP. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that PACs two to four units long (dimers, trimers, and tetramers) were being released from dentin into media, influencing cell behavior. Overall, the results suggested that PAC dimers, trimers, and tetramers are not only biocompatible, but enhance the differentiation of DPCs towards a phenotype that favors biomineralization. PAC-enriched refined mixtures can influence the field of biomaterials and regeneration by serving as renewable, non-cytotoxic agents that can increase the mechanical properties of biomaterials.   Statement of Significance   Pine bark extract is a renewable source of structurally diverse proanthocyanidins (PACs), multifunctional compounds whose interaction with collagen can be tailored to specific purposes by enrichment of selected PACs from the complex mixture. Oligomeric PACs were enriched from the extract and were shown here to sustain desired tissue modification and were thus assessed for cellular response in a model of the dentin-pulp interface. This model was developed to mimic leaching of potentially reactive compounds into pulp tissue. Dental pulp cells exposed to PAC-treated dentin showed increased proliferation and expression of genes necessary for extracellular matrix deposition and biomineralization, processes crucial for forming new dentin. Thus, collagen-interactive PACs may also enhance tissue regeneration and have broad impact in tissue engineering. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Its vectorial capacity is directly affected by its reproductive feeding behaviors, such as host seeking, blood feeding, resting, and egg laying. In mosquitoes, these gonotrophic behaviors are odor-mediated and regulated following blood feeding. Immediately after a blood meal, female mosquitoes show reduced olfactory responsiveness and flight activity, as they enter a resting state. Insights into antennal chemosensory gene regulation at this time period can provide a foundation to identify targets involved in the state switch between host seeking and resting.   Results: This study used quantitative gene expression analyses to explore blood meal induced regulation of chemosensory gene families in the antennae of 6 days post-emergence C. quinquefasciatus females. Improved annotations for multiple chemosensory gene families, and a quantitative differential gene expression analysis between host seeking and 24 h post-blood fed females of the same age, allowed for the detection of transcripts that potentially play a role in the switch from host seeking to resting, in C. quinquefasciatus. The expression profiles of chemosensory genes varied significantly between the two treatments.   Conclusions: Annotations for chemosensory gene repertoires in C. quinquefasciatus have been manually curated and corrected for 3' exon choice and transcript length, through sequence and transcriptome analyses. The gene expression analyses identified various molecular components of the peripheral olfactory system in C. quinquefasciatus, including odorant receptors, ionotropic receptors, odorant binding proteins and chemosensory proteins, that are regulated in response to blood feeding, and could be critical for the behavioral switch from host seeking to resting.

We investigated the tactic fitness structure for maintenance of alternative reproductive tactics in scarab dung beetles that constitute the first known examples of conditional male trimorphism. We parameterized a novel ternary fitness landscape that explains how conditional male trimorphism in these beetles can be maintained. We tracked changes in tactic frequencies in a wild population of Phanaeus triangularis and detected fitness intransitivity consistent with RPS dynamics. Quantitative predictions of our model compare favorably with corresponding observed parameters.

However, for female mate choice, especially, this is poorly known. To complicate matters, both male sexual traits and female mate choice typically show condition dependence, implying that environmental effects probably play an important synergistic role. Using a cross-fostering design, we therefore aimed to disentangle genetic, environmental and their potential interacting effects to investigate how they affect the expression of a sexually selected trait (here birdsong) and female mate choice. To assess environmental effects, we focused on the role of the social environment and thus on learned components. Among the different male song traits investigated, we found a high heritability for song bout length and song bout repertoire, as well as an intriguing gene-by-environment interaction for song bout repertoire. Specifically, the tutor appeared to negatively affect the song bout repertoire of the tutee when his genetic father had a large song bout repertoire but had a positive effect on descendants from fathers with small song bout repertoires. In contrast, we did not detect significant heritability in female mate choice. Female mate choice contained a learned component as females significantly disfavoured their foster father in the mate choice tests, indicating a learned inbreeding avoidance. Thus, our study provides important insights into the role of the social environment for both birdsong and female mate choice. However, the absence of a heritable component in female mate choice suggests a need for studies investigating the heritability of female preferences for (heritable) male song traits in order to gain a better understanding of a potential coevolution between male sexual traits and female mate choice. Overall, our results suggest that indirect genetic effects acting during the pre- and postfledging social contexts may play a prominent role in sexual selection.

However, evolutionary and behavioural ecologists have mainly focused on estimating between-individual variance in mean trait and neglected variation in within-individual variance, or predictability of a trait. In fact, an important assumption of mixed-effects models used to estimate between-individual variance in mean traits is that within-individual residual variance (predictability) is identical across individuals. Individual heterogeneity in the predictability of behaviours is a potentially important effect but rarely estimated and accounted for. We used 11389 measures of docility behaviour from 1576 yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) to estimate between-individual variation in both mean docility and its predictability. We then implemented a double hierarchical animal model to decompose the variances of both mean trait and predictability into their environmental and genetic components. We found that individuals differed both in their docility and in their predictability of docility with a negative phenotypic covariance. We also found significant genetic variance for both mean docility and its predictability but no genetic covariance between the two. This analysis is one of the first to estimate the genetic basis of bothmean trait and within-individual variance in a wild population. Our results indicate that equal within-individual variance should not be assumed. We demonstrate the evolutionary importance of the variation in the predictability of docility and illustrate potential bias in models ignoring variation in predictability. We conclude that the variability in the predictability of a trait should not be ignored, and present a coherent approach for its quantification.","individuals differed in their docility and predictability, with a negative phenotypic covariance.

B.", Genetic variation in social environment construction influences the   development of aggressive behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,118,2017," Individuals are not merely subject to their social environments; they choose and create them, through a process called social environment (or social niche) construction. When genotypes differ in social environment-constructing behaviors, different genotypes are expected to experience different social environments. As social experience often affects behavioral development, quantitative genetics and psychology theories predict that genetic variation in social environment construction should have an important role in determining phenotypic variation; however, this hypothesis has not been tested directly. I identify multiple mechanisms of social environment construction that differ among natural genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster and investigate their consequences for the development of aggressive behavior. Male genotypes differed in the group sizes that they preferred and in their aggressive behavior; both of these behaviors influenced social experience, demonstrating that these behaviors function as social environment-constructing traits. Further, the effects of social experience-as determined in part by social environment construction-carried over to affect focal male aggression at a later time and with a new opponent. These results provide manipulative experimental support for longstanding hypotheses in psychology, that genetic variation in social environment construction has a causal role in behavioral development. More broadly, these results imply that studies of the genetic basis of complex traits should be expanded to include mechanisms by which genetic variation shapes the environments that individuals experience.","geneti variation in social environment construction should have an importnt role in phenotypic variation. test this with the development of aggressive behavior - male genotypes differed in group sizes they preferred and aggressive behaviors, influencing social eperience (they construct social environment.

After applying mixed-effects models to reveal the sign of the covariation, we applied structural equation models to an individual-level covariance matrix to examine whether the RMR generates covariation between the measured behaviours. All traits showed among-individual variation and covariation: RMR and boldness were positively correlated, RMR and exploration were negatively correlated, and boldness and exploration were negatively correlated. However, the RMR was not a causal factor generating covariation between boldness and exploration. Instead, the covariation between all three traits was explained by another, unmeasured mechanism. The selection lines differed from each other in all measured traits and significantly affected the covariance matrix structure between the traits, suggesting that there is a genetic component in the trait integration.

We also discuss the genetic comorbidity estimated from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) between ADHD and major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (E), major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A high genetic comorbidity was found between E and BD (46%), a moderate comorbidity between MDD and E, MDD and BD and MDD and ADHD (18%, 22% and 10% respectively) and a low comorbidity between E and ASD (2.5%). Furthermore, we show evidence concerning the genetic determination of psychiatric diseases, which is significantly lower when it is estimated from genome wide SNP's rather than using traditional quantitative genetic methodology (ADHD = E = 23%, BD = 25%, MDD = 21% and ASD =17%). From an evolutionary perspective, we suggest that behavioral traits such as hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity, which play a role in ADHD and perhaps also other hereditary traits which are part of major psychiatric disorders, could have had a high adaptive value during the early stages of the evolution of Homo sapiens. However, they became progressively less adaptive and definitively disadvantageous, to the extreme that they are involved in frequently diagnosed major psychiatric disorders.","SNPs used to look for 'comorbidity' between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder and schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ADHD.

Thus, both can influence population dynamics. However, the underlying mechanisms that determine variation in personality traits are poorly understood. Maternal effects are one potential mechanism that may explain personality variation. We capitalized on a long-term study of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmotaflaviventris) to identify maternal effects on juvenile docility. To do so, we partitioned the variance in juvenile docility using a quantitative genetic modeling approach to isolate potential maternal effects. We also directly tested whether maternal stress, measured through fecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels during lactation of 82 mothers, was associated with offspring docility. Docility scores were estimated for 645 juveniles trapped between 2002 and 2012. We found an interaction between maternal glucocorticoid levels and dam age on juvenile docility. We also found significant maternal, litter, permanent environment, and year effects. These results suggest that a mother's life history stage interacts with stress to influence offspring personality. This early life influence can have long lasting effects on an individual's docility throughout life. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, the question of whether heritabilities change across environmental gradients has received little empirical attention, particularly for wild vertebrates. We tested whether levels of heritable variation in body size, morphology and survival of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) differed between water flow regimes. We exposed individuals of known genetic relationships to rearing habitats characterized by slow and rapid water flows in a field experiment. We found that the additive genetic variation in body size tended to be higher for individuals reared under rapid water flows. By contrast, the heritabilities of other morphological traits were not consistently higher in either water flow. We also found that salmon grew faster under rapid water flows but also suffered high mortality rates with little heritable variation explaining the variation in survival. However, part of the variation in survival in the rapid water flow was explained by maternal effects. Our results suggest a strong tendency for heritable variation, particularly in body size to be revealed only under specific environmental conditions, such as those that allow for rapid growth. We provide support for the hypothesis that genotype by environment interactions have important effects on the adaptive potential of phenotypes in nature.","do heritabilities change cross environmental gradients? additive genetic variation in body size was higher for individuals reared under rapid water flows and they had high mortality rates, which wasexplainedby maternal effects.

In spite of extensive research on feather pecking during the last decades, the motivation for this behavior is still not clear. A small to moderate heritability has frequently been reported for these traits. Recently, we identified several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with feather pecking by mapping selection signatures in two divergent feather pecking lines. Here, we performed a genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) for feather pecking and aggressive pecking behavior, then combined the results with those from the recent selection signature experiment, and linked them to those obtained from a differential gene expression study.   Methods: A large F2 cross of 960 F2 hens was generated using the divergent lines as founders. Hens were phenotyped for feather pecks delivered (FPD), aggressive pecks delivered (APD), and aggressive pecks received (APR). Individuals were genotyped with the Illumina 60K chicken Infinium iSelect chip. After data filtering, 29,376 SNPs remained for analyses. Single-marker GWAS was performed using a Poisson model. The results were combined with those from the selection signature experiment using Fisher's combined probability test.   Results: Numerous significant SNPs were identified for all traits but with low false discovery rates. Nearly all significant SNPs were located in clusters that spanned a maximum of 3 Mb and included at least two significant SNPs. For FPD, four clusters were identified, which increased to 13 based on the meta-analysis (FPDmeta). Seven clusters were identified for APD and three for APR. Eight genes (of the 750 investigated genes located in the FPDmeta clusters) were significantly differentially-expressed in the brain of hens from both lines. One gene, SLC12A9, and the positional candidate gene for APD, GNG2, may be linked to the monomanine signaling pathway, which is involved in feather pecking and aggressive behavior.   Conclusions: Combining the results from the GWAS with those of the selection signature experiment substantially increased the statistical power. The behavioral traits were controlled by many genes with small effects and no single SNP had effects large enough to justify its use in marker-assisted selection.",identified genes associated with feather pecking and aggressive pecking,Gallus gallus domesticus,chickens,Aves,used GWAS from F2 cross to identify SNPs,"F2 cross, GWAS","behvioral traits were controlled by many genes, and using GWAS plus selection signatures improved power",no,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,not human

Three main results were derived from the present analyses. First, graph-theoretical measures of hippocampal connectivity were altered in depression. Specifically, decreased connectivity strength and increased network centrality of the right hippocampus were found in depressed individuals. Second, these hippocampal alterations are potentially driven by familial factors (genes plus shared environment). Third, there is an additive interaction effect between FKBP5's rs1360780 variant and the graph-theoretical metrics of hippocampal connectivity to influence depression risk.

We did so for the damselfly genus Enallagma which strongly diverged in antipredator traits when the ancestral species occupying lakes containing fish (hereafter fish lakes) repeatedly invaded fishless lakes with dragonfly larvae as top predators (hereafter dragonfly lakes). In two selection experiments in field enclosures we quantified the selection on two key escape traits of two fish-lake Enallagma species associated with survival selection by fish in the ancestral fish lakes and by dragonfly predators in the invaded fishless, dragonfly lakes. In accordance with the different hunting modes, fish imposed selection for a decreased swimming propensity while dragonfly larvae imposed selection for increased swimming speed in one of the two species. In two complementary quantitative genetic rearing experiments, we found relatively low but significant broad-sense heritabilities for both escape traits. Integrating these estimates for the selection coefficients and the heritabilities suggests that the evolutionary increase in swimming speed associated with the habitat shift may have occurred rapidly. Our study suggests that the phenotypic evolution of ecologically important traits related to habitat shifts may occur at an ecological timescale.

Phenotypic variation exists in and at all levels of biological organization: variation exists among species, among-individuals within-populations, and in the case of l within-populations abile traits, within-individuals. Mixed-effects models represent ideal tools to quantify multilevel measurements of traits and are being increasingly used in evolutionary ecology. Mixed-effects models are relatively complex, and two main issues may be hampering their proper usage: (i) the relatively few educational resources available to teach new users how to implement and interpret them and (ii) the lack of tools to ensure that the statistical parameters of interest are correctly estimated. In this paper, we introduce Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences (SQuID), a simulation-based tool that can be used for research and educational purposes. SQuID creates a virtual world inhabited by subjects whose phenotypes are generated by a user-defined phenotypic equation, which allows easy translation of biological hypotheses into quantifiable parameters. Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences currently models normally distributed traits with linear predictors, but SQuID is subject to further development and will adapt to handle more complex scenarios in the future. The current framework is suitable for performing simulation studies, determining optimal sampling designs for user-specific biological problems and making simulation-based inferences to aid in the interpretation of empirical studies. Statistical Quantification of Individual Differences is also a teaching tool for biologists interested in learning, or teaching others, how to implement and interpret linear mixed-effects models when studying the processes causing phenotypic variation. Interface-based modules allow users to learn about these issues. As research on effects of sampling designs continues, new issues will be implemented in new modules, including nonlinear and non-Gaussian data.",important to be able to quntify within-individual and within population variation,,,,stats tool,,not relevant,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Restoration often relies on revegetation that, on large scales, requires agronomic increase of native plant materials. During this propagation process, restoration populations are subject to genetic sampling as well as natural and artificial selection that could result in adaptation contrasting sharply with that of native populations. Here we draw on insights from the evolutionary and agricultural literature to illustrate how changes in the amount and type of genetic variation in ex situ repositories (source collections and production farms) could affect plant performance in restoration. The consequences of intentional and/or inadvertent evolutionary modification of restoration materials are discussed with respect to population viability and ecosystem function.Synthesis and applications. We conclude that sampling effects and intentional and unintentional selection during collection, propagation and restoration planting have the potential to diminish restored populations. We describe testing for evolutionary change in plant materials using neutral molecular markers and/or field observations.

These behaviors are associated, but the extent to which their etiological architecture overlaps is unknown. The objective of this study was to quantify the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences to variation in FF and FN in early childhood; and to establish the extent to which they share common genetic and environmental influences.   MethodParticipants were 1,921 families with 16-month-old twins from the Gemini birth cohort. Parents completed the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire which included three FF items and four FN items. Bivariate quantitative genetic modeling was used to quantify: (a) genetic and environmental contributions to variation in FF and FN; and (b) the extent to which genetic or environmental influences on FF and FN are shared across the traits.   ResultsFood fussiness and FN were strongly correlated (r=.72, p<.001). Proportions of variation in FF were equally explained by genetic (.46; 95% CI: 0.41-0.52) and shared environmental influences (.46; 95% CI: 0.41-0.51). Shared environmental effects accounted for a significantly lower proportion of variation in FN (.22; 95% CI: 0.14-0.30), but genetic influences were not significantly different from those on FF (.58, 95% CI: 0.50-0.67). FF and FN largely shared a common etiology, indicated by high genetic (.73; 95% CI: 0.67-0.78) and shared environmental correlations (.78; 95% CI: 0.69-0.86) across the two traits.

This has impacts not only on criminal justice interventions but also on the physical and mental health of these communities including their risk for acquiring life-threatening diseases. While many studies have focused on the effects of violence on African American males, we sought to understand the relative gender effects that violence has on African American females. This is of particular interest given the wide array of scientific literature suggesting maternal health has inter-generational health effects. Understanding gender differences associated with exposure to violence, depression, and immune function is an important step in understanding how young women perceive and internalize societal violence directed toward and around them. We analyzed a cohort of 557 young African American adults aged 18-25years old from the Washington, DC area. We use sociological, epidemiological, mental health, computational biology, and quantitative genetics approaches to build a predictive portrait of the effects of violence on African American health. This study demonstrates that African American males and females experience different constellations of societal violence, that African American women report greater perception of racial and gender bias, and that cortisol, an indicator of stress response, is correlated to perceived discrimination. This work contributes to current understandings of how violence contributes to negative health outcomes and lays the foundation for a predictive model for sociological, health, and behavior risk that young African Americans encounter.","violence has sex-specific effects within an African American community, likely impacting maternal effects of offspring",humans,,,"analyzed sociological, epidemiological, mental health, computational biolgoy and quantitative genetics",,interesting but not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Hand preference in humans is easily determined and available for tens of thousands of individuals for which genomic data are also available. Yet, strong genetic candidates for hand preference have not been proposed yet. Genetics analyses using quantitative measures of handedness have demonstrated that genes involved in establishing left/right structural laterality play a role in controlling behavioral laterality. Therefore it is crucial how handedness is measured and it is clear that other genetic determinants remain to be discovered.

Because the mere behaviourally informed quantitative genetics give a much higher effect size of the genetic involvement in ADHD, it is important that study books contrast these findings with molecular genetics' outcomes. The latter studies use real genetic data, and their low effect sizes expose the potential weaknesses of quantitative genetics, like underestimating the involvement of the environment.

Here, we use a multivariate quantitative genetic approach to study phenotypic and genetic correlations between parental and offspring traits in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. To this end, we recorded 2 prenatal traits (clutch size and egg size), 2 postnatal parental behaviors (direct care directed toward larvae and indirect care directed toward resource maintenance), 1 offspring behavior (begging), and 2 measures of breeding success (larval dispersal mass and number of dispersing larvae). Females breeding on larger carcasses provided less direct care but produced larger larvae than females breeding on smaller carcasses. Furthermore, there were positive phenotypic correlations between clutch size, direct, and indirect care. Both egg size and direct care were positively correlated with dispersal mass, whereas clutch size was negatively correlated with dispersal mass. Clutch size and number of dispersed larvae showed genetic variance both in terms of differences between populations of origin and significant heritabilities. However, we found no evidence of genetic variance underlying other parental or offspring traits.

Evidence from Two   Large Twin Studies,47,2017," In modern societies, individual differences in completed fertility are linked with genotypic differences between individuals. Explaining the heritability of completed fertility has been inconclusive, with alternative explanations centering on family formation timing, pursuit of education, or other psychological traits. We use the twin subsample from the Midlife Development in the United States study and the TwinsUK study to examine these issues. In total, 2606 adult twin pairs reported on their completed fertility, age at first birth and marriage, level of education, Big Five personality traits, and cognitive ability. Quantitative genetic Cholesky models were used to partition the variance in completed fertility into genetic and environmental variance that is shared with other phenotypes and residual variance. Genetic influences on completed fertility are strongly related to family formation timing and less strongly, but significantly, with psychological traits. Multivariate models indicate that family formation, demographic, and psychological phenotypes leave no residual genetic variance in completed fertility in either dataset. Results are largely consistent across U.S. and U.K. sociocultural contexts.","fertility is linked to genotypic differences, and genetic influences are strongly related to family formation timing and psychological traits",humans,,,quantitative genetic cholesky models used on twin data,,interesting but not most compelling,probably no,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,human

Plants may affect these processes directly or indirectly via the interaction with the rhizosphere community. Many studies on the impact of plant functional traits on ecosystem processes in wetlands focused on variability among species, neglecting the importance of intraspecific variability. Here we assessed the intraspecific genetically based variability of a common wetland plant for traits, potentially relevant for the removal of nitrogen compounds from the soil. We asked whether and how quantitative genetic variation is expressed differently depending on nitrogen availability and how it is structured within and among natural European populations of Juncus effusus. We partitioned the observed genetic variation into within- (broad-sense heritability) and among (Q(ST)) population components for mean traits and plasticities. We found a strong plastic behavior for all measured traits in response to nitrogen availability. Genetic variation for mean traits differed strongly among populations but was very low at population level. We could not demonstrate a general effect of nitrogen availability on genetic trait expression. Our results suggest that basic and applied studies on wetland ecosystem processes will benefit from a deeper understanding of intraspecific genetic variation for traits and plastic behavior which is also fundamental for breeding approaches or to predict evolutionary responses.

Individuals coping style was characterized through behavior tests at four different ages, categorizing fish into proactive or reactive: a hypoxia avoidance test (at 255 days post hatching, dph) and 3 risk-taking tests (at 276, 286 and 304 dph). We observed significant heritability of the coping style, higher for the average of risk-taking scores (h(2) = 0.45 +/- 0.14) than for the hypoxia avoidance test (h(2) = 0.19 +/- 0.10). The genetic correlations between the three risk-taking scores were very high (r(A) = 0.96-0.99) showing that although their repeatability was moderately high (r(P) = 0.64-0.72), successive risk-taking tests evaluated the same genetic variation. A mild genetic correlation between the results of the hypoxia avoidance test and the average of risk-taking scores (0.45 +/- 0.27) suggested that hypoxia avoidance and risk-taking tests do not address exactly the same behavioral and physiological responses. Genetic correlations between weight and risk taking traits showed negative values whatever the test used in our population i.e. reactive individual weights were larger.

Critics argue that the field is riddled with terminological and methodological inconsistencies and lacks a sound theoretical framework. Nevertheless, experimental biologists are increasingly studying individual differences in physiology and relating these to differences in behaviour, which can lead to fascinating insights. We encourage this trend, and in this Commentary we highlight some of the benefits of estimating variation in (and covariation among) phenotypic traits at the inter-and intra-individual levels. We focus on behaviour while drawing parallels with physiological and performance-related traits. First, we outline some of the confusion surrounding the terminology used to describe repeatable inter-individual differences in behaviour. Second, we argue that acknowledging individual behavioural differences can help researchers avoid sampling and experimental bias, increase explanatory power and, ultimately, understand how selection acts on physiological traits. Third, we summarize the latest methods to collect, analyse and present data on individual trait variation. We note that, while measuring the repeatability of phenotypic traits is informative in its own right, it is only the first step towards understanding how natural selection and genetic architecture shape intra-specific variation in complex, labile traits. Thus, understanding how and why behavioural traits evolve requires linking repeatable inter-individual behavioural differences with core aspects of physiology (e.g. neurophysiology, endocrinology, energy metabolism) and evolutionary biology (e.g. selection gradients, heritability).",draw paralles between behavior and physiological and performance related traits with personality. ,,,,commentary,,might be a good summary of personality work,maybe,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

P.   van Noordwijk, Arie J.", Stable partial migration under a genetic threshold model of migratory   behaviour,39,2016," Many species show migratory behaviour in response to seasonal changes in environmental conditions. A peculiar, yet widespread phenomenon is partial migration, when a single population consists of both migratory and non-migratory individuals. There are still many open questions regarding the stability and evolutionary significance of such populations. For passerines the inheritance of migratory activity is best described by the threshold model of quantitative genetics. Such a model has not yet been employed in theoretical studies, in which stability of partially migratory populations is usually linked to group differences in survival or reproduction. Here we develop a parsimonious model featuring a conditional genetic threshold for passerine migratory behaviour under which stable partial migration can be observed, and we explore the resulting selection landscape. Our model results show a cline in migratory behaviour across the landscape, from fully migratory populations to fully residential populations, with a fairly wide zone of partially migratory populations, which is stable in both time and space under a wide range of parameter settings. Temporal stability of the zone is linked with the yearly variance in both migration survival and resident winter survival. In contrast to other theoretical studies, we show that density dependence in winter survival is not essential for observing partially migratory populations. In addition, we observe that selection on the genetic threshold value occurs mainly at the borders of the zone of partial migration. This result suggests that fully migratory and fully residential populations in areas far from the zone of partial migration can harbour genetic diversity that allows the appearance of the alternative phenotype under (a wide range of) different conditions.",conditional genetic threshold for migratory behavior und which stable partial migration can be observed.

Estimates of quantitative genetic variation in behavioral traits of farmed animals have previously been reported, with estimates of heritability ranging widely. However, for the consistency of choice in dairy cows, almost no published estimates of heritability exist. The hypothesis for this study was that choice consistency is partly under additive genetic control and partly controlled by permanent environmental (animal) effects. The aims of this study were to obtain estimates of genetic and phenotypic parameters for choice consistency in dairy cows milked in AMS herds. Data were obtained from 5 commercial Danish herds (I-V) with 2 AMS milking boxes (A, B). Milking data were only from milkings where both the present and the previous milkings were coded as completed. This filter was used to fulfill a criterion of free-choice situation (713,772 milkings, 1,231 cows). The lactation was divided into 20 segments covering 15 d each, from 5 to 305 d in milk. Choice consistency scores were obtained as the fraction of milkings without change of box [i.e., 1.0 gbox change)] for each segment. Data were analyzed for one part of lactation at a time using a linear mixed model for first-parity cows alone and for all parities jointly. Choice consistency was found to be only weakly heritable (heritability = 0.02 to 0.14) in first as well as in later parities, and having intermediate repeatability (repeatability coefficients = 0.27 to 0.56). Heritability was especially low at early and late lactation states. These results indicate that consistency, which is itself an indication of repeated similar choices, is also repeatable as a trait observed over longer time periods. However, the genetic background seems to play a smaller role compared with that of the permanent animal effects, indicating that consistency could also be a learned behavior. We concluded that consistency in choices are quantifiable, but only under weak genetic control.","cows choose specific milking boxes, and the consistency of choice was only weakly heritable with intermediate repeatability.

Quantitative genetic methods enable more effective selection on single or multiple complex traits than selection on phenotypes because of the estimation of additive genetic variance in the population (the chief cause of resemblance of relatives and the only genetic component that can be estimated from observations on the population) and estimated breeding values of individuals. Estimation of genetic correlations between multiple traits reveals the effects selection on 1 trait will have on the breeding values of others and inform of unfavorable genetic relationships between objective traits. Improvement in multiple traits can be optimized via the use of selection indices, making the best use of all phenotypic information available to achieve specific selection objectives. Therefore, quantitative methods offer effective means of improving the accuracy of selection of behavioral traits. Quantitative genetic methods use phenotypic data on a large and representative proportion of the population, which have in livestock species typically taken the form of empirical measurement of continuous variables. Obtaining behavioral phenotypes presents challenges inherent in quantifying behaviors, but certain steps can be taken in the design of phenotypic protocols to ensure that phenotypic data are conducive to quantitative genetic analysis.

So far, evidence for accurate kin recognition, when individuals distinguish fine scale differences in genetic relatedness, in social insects is mixed. Although this ability should be counter selected to reduce risks of nepotism in eusocial colonies, accurate kin recognition may be beneficial in less integrated societies where genetic conflicts are reduced. Here we show that gregarious cockroaches Blattella germanica discriminate multiple levels of relatedness and identify inherited cuticular odors as potential kin recognition cues. When given a choice between aggregation sites containing either full siblings or less related conspecifics, cockroaches showed an increasing preference for resting with full siblings with increasing genetic distance between stimuli groups, from 50% of choices in the presence of half siblings or cousins, to 60.7% with less related cockroaches from the same strain, and 72.9% with cockroaches from a different strain. Examination of the cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of 288 nymphs and their 54 parents revealed that the chemical distance between cockroaches was negatively correlated to their relatedness. Using a Bayesian animal model approach for quantitative genetic analyses, we identified several highly heritable methyl-branched alkanes as good candidates for kin recognition cues.

Many traits of evolutionary interest, including many life history and behavioral traits, have inherently nonnormal distributions. The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) framework has become a widely used tool for estimating quantitative genetic parameters for nonnormal traits. However, whereas GLMMs provide inference on a statistically convenient latent scale, it is often desirable to express quantitative genetic parameters on the scale upon which traits are measured. The parameters of fitted GLMMs, despite being on a latent scale, fully determine all quantities of potential interest on the scale on which traits are expressed. We provide expressions for deriving each of such quantities, including population means, phenotypic (co)variances, variance components including additive genetic (co)variances, and parameters such as heritability. We demonstrate that fixed effects have a strong impact on those parameters and show how to deal with this by averaging or integrating over fixed effects. The expressions require integration of quantities determined by the link function, over distributions of latent values. In general cases, the required integrals must be solved numerically, but efficient methods are available and we provide an implementation in an R package, QGglmm. We show that known formulas for quantities such as heritability of traits with binomial and Poisson distributions are special cases of our expressions. Additionally, we show how fitted GLMM can be incorporated into existing methods for predicting evolutionary trajectories. We demonstrate the accuracy of the resulting method for evolutionary prediction by simulation and apply our approach to data from a wild pedigreed vertebrate population.",Methods to express GLMMs on the scale at which traits are expressed. ,,,,stats methods paper,,good reference for how to do these studies,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

During range shifts, species experience multiple selection pressures. For poleward expansions in particular, it is difficult to interpret observed evolutionary dynamics because of the joint action of evolutionary processes related to spatial selection and to adaptation toward local climatic conditions. To disentangle the effects of these two processes, we integrated stochastic modeling and data from a common garden experiment, using the spider mite Tetranychus urticae as a model species. By linking the empirical data with those derived form a highly parameterized individual-based model, we infer that both spatial selection and local adaptation contributed to the observed latitudinal life-history divergence. Spatial selection best described variation in dispersal behavior, while variation in development was best explained by adaptation to the local climate. Divergence in life-history traits in species shifting poleward could consequently be jointly determined by contemporary evolutionary dynamics resulting from adaptation to the environmental gradient and from spatial selection. The integration of modeling with common garden experiments provides a powerful tool to study the contribution of these evolutionary processes on life-history evolution during range expansion.",spatial selection and local adaptation contributed to the observed life history divergence,Tetranychus urticae,two-spotted spider mite,Arachnida,integrated stochastic modeling and a common garden experiment,common-garden,good example of how to combine multiple approaches,Yes,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,not human

While phenotypic changes in female mating traits have been previously studied, little is known about the genetic basis of female mating behaviour and its potential to respond to selection at different stages throughout an individual's life. Using a large quantitative genetic breeding design, we observed lifetime female mating behaviour in Drosophila melanogaster to examine the effect of female age and mating history on three key mating traits: courtship latency, mating latency and copula duration. Courtship latency (time until males initiate courtship) decreased with the cumulative number of females' previous matings. Mating latency (defined here as the time between the beginning of courtship and the start of copulation) increased with female age, and copula duration was found to decrease as females aged. We calculated quantitative genetic estimates for mating traits in virgin females and at the females' third mating to examine changes in the evolutionary potential of mating traits. We found considerable additive genetic variation in courtship latency and mating latency measured in virgin females. Copula duration displayed no heritable variation among females across sire families, but male effects were consistent with the idea that this trait is under male control. Heritability estimates differed significantly from zero in virgin females for courtship latency and mating latency but not when females were mating for the third time. However, overlapping 84% confidence intervals between heritability estimates obtained from virgin and mated females suggest that female mating strategies may have the potential to respond to selection at these different life stages.

Weaver, Timothy D.", A Mixed Model for the Relationship Between Climate and Human Cranial   Form,160,2016," Objectives: We expand upon a multivariate mixed model from quantitative genetics in order to estimate the magnitude of climate effects in a global sample of recent human crania. In humans, genetic distances are correlated with distances based on cranial form, suggesting that population structure influences both genetic and quantitative trait variation. Studies controlling for this structure have demonstrated significant underlying associations of cranial distances with ecological distances derived from climate variables. However, to assess the biological importance of an ecological predictor, estimates of effect size and uncertainty in the original units of measurement are clearly preferable to significance claims based on units of distance. Unfortunately, the magnitudes of ecological effects are difficult to obtain with distance-based methods, while models that produce estimates of effect size generally do not scale to high-dimensional data like cranial shape and form.   Methods: Using recent innovations that extend quantitative genetics mixed models to highly multivariate observations, we estimate morphological effects associated with a climate predictor for a subset of the Howells craniometric dataset.   Results: Several measurements, particularly those associated with cranial vault breadth, show a substantial linear association with climate, and the multivariate model incorporating a climate predictor is preferred in model comparison.   Conclusions: Previous studies demonstrated the existence of a relationship between climate and cranial form. The mixed model quantifies this relationship concretely. Evolutionary questions that require population structure and phylogeny to be disentangled from potential drivers of selection may be particularly well addressed by mixed models.

The mechanisms that determine ""jacking rate""-the rate at which males precociously sexually mature-are known to involve both genetics and differential growth rates, where individuals that become jacks exhibit higher growth earlier in life. The additive genetic components have been studied and it is known that jack sires produce significantly more jack offspring than hooknose sires, and vice versa. The current study was the first to investigate both additive and non-additive genetic components underlying jacking through the use of a full-factorial breeding design using all hooknose sires. The effect of dams and sires descendant from a marker-assisted broodstock program that identified ""high performance"" and ""low performance"" lines using growth-and survival-related gene markers was also studied. Finally, the relative growth of jack, hooknose, and female offspring was examined. No significant dam, sire, or interaction effects were observed in this study, and the maternal, additive, and non-additive components underlying jacking were small. Differences in jacking rates in this study were determined by dam performance line, where dams that originated from the low performance line produced significantly more jacks. Jack offspring in this study had a significantly larger body size than both hooknose males and females starting 1 year post-fertilization. This study provides novel information regarding the genetic architecture underlying ARTs in Chinook salmon that could have implications for the aquaculture industry, where jacks are not favoured due to their small body size and poor flesh quality.","no significant dam, sire, or interaction effects were observed and jacking had small maternal additive, and non-additive components.

We therefore developed a novel approach for isolating polymorphic microsatellites from the club-legged grasshopper (Gomphocerus sibiricus), an emerging quantitative genetic and behavioral model system. Whole genome shotgun Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to generate over three million 300 bp paired-end reads, of which 67.75% were grouped into 40,548 clusters within RepeatExplorer. Annotations of the top 468 clusters, which represent 60.5% of the reads, revealed homology to satellite DNA and a variety of transposable elements. Evaluating 96 primer pairs in eight wild-caught individuals, we found that primers mined from singleton reads were six times more likely to amplify a single polymorphic microsatellite locus than primers mined from clusters. Our study provides experimental evidence in support of the notion that microsatellites associated with repetitive elements are less likely to successfully amplify. It also reveals how advances in high-throughput sequencing and graph-based repetitive DNA analysis can be leveraged to isolate polymorphic microsatellites from complex genomes.",used HPS to identify microsatellites. not quantitative genetics,Gomphocerus sibiricus,grasshopper,Insecta,Illumina ,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

W.", Genetic variation but weak genetic covariation between pre- and   post-copulatory episodes of sexual selection in Drosophila melanogaster,29,2016," When females mate polyandrously, male reproductive success depends both on the male's ability to attain matings and on his ability to outcompete rival males in the fertilization of ova post-copulation. Increased investment in ejaculate components may trade off with investment in precopulatory traitsdue to resource allocation. Alternatively, pre- and post-copulatory traits could be positively related if individuals can afford to invest heavily intraits advantageous at both episodes of selection. There is empirical evidence for both positive and negative associations between pre- and post-copulatory episodes, but little is known about the genetic basis of these correlations. In this study, we measured morphological, chemical and behavioural precopulatory male traits and investigated their relationship with measures of male fitness (male mating success, remating inhibition and offensive sperm competitiveness) across 40 isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster. We found significant variation among isofemale lines, indicating a genetic basis for most of the traits investigated. However, we found weak evidence for genetic correlations between precopulatory traits and our indices of male fitness. Moreover, pre- and post-copulatory episodes of selection were uncorrelated, suggesting selection may act independently at the different episodes to maximize male reproductive success.","significant variation among lines indicating a genetic basis for most of the morphological, chemical, and behavioral traits.

This synthesis can be viewed through the breeder's equation, a cornerstone of quantitative genetics that, in its univariate form, states that a population's evolutionary response is the product of the heritability of a trait and selection on that trait (R = h(2)S). Under this framework, evolutionary endocrinologists have begun to quantify the heritability of, and the strength of selection on, a variety of hormonal phenotypes. With specific reference to our work on testosterone and corticosterone in birds and lizards, we review these studies while emphasizing the challenges of applying this framework to hormonal phenotypes that are inherently plastic and mediate adaptive responses to environmental variation. Next, we consider the untapped potential of evolutionary endocrinology as a framework for exploring multivariate versions of the breeder's equation, with emphasis on the role of hormones in structuring phenotypic and genetic correlations. As an extension of the familiar concepts of phenotypic integration and hormonal pleiotropy, we illustrate how the hormonal milieu of an individual acts as a local environment for the expression of genes and phenotypes, thereby influencing the quantitative genetic architecture of multivariate phenotypes. We emphasize that hormones are more than mechanistic links in the translation of genotype to phenotype: by virtue of their pleiotropic effects on gene expression, hormones structure the underlying genetic variances and covariances that determine a population's evolutionary response to selection.",hormones structure the underlyinggenetic variances and covariances that determine a population's evolutionary response to selection,,,,position piece,,good perspective on evolutionary endocrinology,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,x,,,,not human

This provides an opportunity to infer putative causal links among the traits. For the analysis, 897 F2-hens set up from 2 lines divergently selected for high and low FP were available. The FP observations were Box-Cox transformed, and FE and GLA observations were log and square root transformed, respectively. The estimated heritabilities of FE, GLA, and FP were 0.36, 0.29, and 0.20, respectively. The genetic correlation between FP and FE (GLA) was 0.17 (0.04). A high genetic correlation of 0.47 was estimated between FE and GLA. The recursive effect from FE to FP was (lambda) over cap (FP, FE) = 0.258, and from GLA to FP (lambda) over cap (FP, GLA) = 0.046. These results imply that an increase of FE leads to an increased FP behavior and that an increase in GLA results in a higher FP value.

Measurements of their personality in nonsocial contexts (activity and exploration behavior) enabled us to ask whether personality caused indirect effects on aggressiveness. Activity, exploration, and aggressiveness were positively associated into a behavioral syndrome eliciting aggressiveness in conspecifics, providing direct evidence for the role of personality in causing indirect effects. Our findings imply that a multivariate view of phenotypes that includes indirect effects greatly improves our ability to understand the ecology and evolution of behavior.","activity exploration and aggressiveness were positively associated into a behavioral syndrome, which elicited aggression in conspecifics, providing evidence for role of personality in indirect effects",Gryllus campestris,field crickets,Insecta,behavioral studies to ask if personal had indirect effects on aggressiveness,repeatability,not exactly quantitative genetics but good personality example,Probably no,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,not human

Huey, Raymond B.", How Extreme Temperatures Impact Organisms and the Evolution of their   Thermal Tolerance,56,2016," Synopsis Understanding the biological impacts of extreme temperatures requires translating meteorological estimates into organismal responses, but that translation is complex. In general, the physiological stress induced by a given thermal extreme should increase with the extreme's magnitude and duration, though acclimation may buffer that stress. However, organisms can differ strikingly in their exposure to and tolerance of a given extreme temperatures. Moreover, their sensitivity to extremes can vary during ontogeny, across seasons, and among species; and that sensitivity and its variation should be subject to selection. We use a simple quantitative genetic model and demonstrate that thermal extremes-even when at low frequency-can substantially influence the evolution of thermal sensitivity, particularly when the extremes cause mortality or persistent physiological injury, or when organisms are unable to use behavior to buffer exposure to extremes. Thermal extremes can drive organisms in temperate and tropical sites to have similar thermal tolerances despite major differences in mean temperatures. Indeed, the model correctly predicts that Australian Drosophila should have shallower latitudinal gradients in thermal tolerance than would be expected based only on gradients in mean conditions. Predicting responses to climate change requires understanding not only how past selection to tolerate thermal extremes has helped establish existing geographic gradients in thermal tolerances, but also how increasing the incidence of thermal extremes will alter geographic gradients in the future.",thermal extremes even at low frequency can influence evolution of thermal sensitivity,Drosophila spp.,fruit flies,Insecta,"quantitative genetic model, theoretical model",,"theoretical model applied to a real world system, but not really behavior",No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Emerging evidence suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) may modulate interpersonal aggression. We here investigated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the OXT receptor gene (OXTR) are associated with the expression of antisocial behavior. A discovery sample, including both sexes, was drawn from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS; n = 2372), and a sample from the Twin Study of Child and Adolescent Development (TCHAD; n = 1232) was used for replication. Eight SNPs in OXTR, selected on previous associations with social and antisocial behavior, were genotyped in the participants of CATSS. Significant polymorphisms were subsequently genotyped in TCHAD for replication. Participants completed self-assessment questionnaires-Life History of Aggression (LHA; available only in CATSS), and Self-Reported Delinquency (SRD; available in both samples)-designed to capture antisocial behavior as continuous traits. In the discovery sample, the rs7632287 AA genotype was associated with higher frequency of antisocial behavior in boys, and this was then replicated in the second sample. In particular, overt aggression (directly targeting another individual) was strongly associated with this genotype in boys (P = 6.2 x 10(-7) in the discovery sample). Meta-analysis of the results for antisocial behavior from both samples yielded P = 2.5 x 10(-5). Furthermore, an association between rs4564970 and LHA (P = 0.00013) survived correction in the discovery sample, but there was no association with the SRD in the replication sample. We conclude that the rs7632287 and rs4564970 polymorphisms in OXTR may independently influence antisocial behavior in adolescent boys. Further replication of our results will be crucial to understanding how aberrant social behavior arises, and would support the OXT receptor as one potential target in the treatment of aggressive antisocial behavior.",identified polymorphisms influencing antisocial behavior in adolescent boys,humans,,,twin studies,,example of looking for genes,No,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,human

Understanding the biological origins of heterogeneity of key intermediate phenotypes such as cognition and emotion can provide novel mechanistic insights into disorder pathogenesis. Performing quantitative genetics in animal models is a tractable strategy for examining both the genetic basis of intermediate phenotypes and functional testing of candidate quantitative traits genes (QTGs). Here, existing and newly collected data were used for collaborative genome-wide mapping of cued fear acquisition and expression in 65 mouse strains from the BXD genetic reference panel. For fear acquisition, we identified a significant locus on chromosome (Chr) 10 and eight suggestive loci on Chr 2, 4, 5, 11, 13, and 15. For fear expression, we identified one significant and another highly suggestive locus on Chr 13, as well as four suggestive loci on Chr 10, 11, and X. Across these loci, 60 putative QTGs were identified. The quantitative trait locus on distal Chr 13 contained a single, highly promising gene at the location of the peak likelihood ratio statistic score. The gene, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1 (Hcn1), regulates neuronal excitability. Validation experiments using behavioral pharmacology revealed that functional Hcn channels in the basolateral amygdala are necessary for conditioned fear acquisition and expression.

Persistency in lay however cannot be achieved without due consideration of how to sustain egg quality and the health and welfare of the birds in longer laying cycles. These multiple goals require knowledge and consideration of the bird's physiology, nutritional requirements, which vary depending on age and management system, reproductive status and choice of the selection criteria applied.The recent advent of molecular genetics offers considerable hope that these multiple elements can be balanced for the good of all in the industry including the hens.The long life layer, which will be capable of producing 500 eggs in a laying cycle of 100 weeks, is therefore on the horizon, bringing with it the benefits of a more efficient utilisation of diminishing resources, including land, water, raw materials for feed as well as a reduction in waste, and an overall reduced carbon footprint.",persistency of egg lay needs to be balanced with egg quality,Gallus gallus domesticus,chickens,Aves,position piece,,not useful,no,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Although empirical studies have investigated how social environments can influence SSB, little is known about the effect of the interacting partner and its associated phenotype on SSB. In species where females are larger than males or males express male-specific behaviour, a male's morphology or behaviour can serve as a way for other males to recognize its sex and express SSBs. Here we used both a trait-based and variance-partitioning approach to test for the effect of the interacting male's identity and his multivariate phenotype on SSB, using water striders, Gerris lacustris, as a model. We repeatedly subjected males to dyadic interactions with the same and different partners and measured their SSBs. We used the variance-partitioning approach to estimate the partner's identity effect, and the trait-based approach to assess which trait of the partner explains changes in SSB. We found that the partner's SSB reduced the tendency of males to show SSB. SSB was affected by their interacting partner's identity, but the partner effect was not due to the repeatable components ('personality') of the partner's SSB. Males also did not differ in their responses to variation in the partner's SSB at different levels (between-partner, or partner 'personality', and within-partner levels, or partner 'plasticity'). Taken together, these findings provide the first empirical evidence that SSB can be plastically expressed in response to traits in social partners. We also highlight the usefulness of combining the trait-based and variance-partitioning approach to test whether partners represent a component of the social environment affecting the expression of labile traits.

Despite this success, quantitative tests of these models using data from sexual radiations are rare. Consequently, we do not know whether realistic versions of the FLP can account for the extent and the rate of evolution of sexually selected traits. To answer this question, we generalize the basic FLP model of sexual coevolution and compare predictions of that basic model with patterns observed in an iconic sexual radiation, birds of paradise. Our model tracks the coevolution of male and female traits (two in each sex) while relaxing some restrictive assumptions. Using computer simulations, we evaluate the behavior of the model and confirm that it is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. We also assess the ability of the FLP to account for the quantitative aspects of ornament evolution in the genus Paradisaea using published measurements of display traits and a phylogeny of the genus. Finally, we use the program OUwie to compare model fits to generic OU and Brownian motion processes and to estimate FLP parameters. We show that to explain the sexual radiation of the genus Paradisaea one must either invoke extremely weak stabilizing selection on female mating preferences or allow the preference optimum to undergo Brownian motion at a modest rate.",sexual radiaiton of birds of paradise requires extremely weak stabilizing selection on female preferences or allow the optimum to shift,Paradisaea,Birds of paradise,Aves,Extension of Fisher-Lande process using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process,other,"already read it, good example",read,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

An example of such an indirect defence is rebellion of enslaved Temnothorax longispinosus ant workers against their social parasite Temnothorax americanus, a slavemaking ant. Ant slaves have been observed to kill their oppressors' offspring, a behaviour from which the sterile slaves cannot profit directly. Parasite brood killing could, however, reduce raiding pressure on related host colonies nearby. We analyse with extensive computer simulations for the Temnothorax slavemaker system under what conditions a hypothetical rebel allele could invade a host population, and in particular, how host-parasite dynamics and population structure influence the rebel allele's success. Exploring a wide range of model parameters, we only found a small number of parameter combinations for which kin selection or multilevel selection could allow a slave rebellion allele to spread in the host population. Furthermore, we did not detect any cases in which the reduction of raiding pressure in the close vicinity of the slavemaker nest would substantially contribute to the inclusive fitness of rebels. This suggests that slave rebellion is not costly and perhaps a side-effect of some other beneficial trait. In some of our simulations, however, even a costly rebellion allele could spread in the population. This was possible when host-parasite interactions led to a metapopulation dynamic with frequent local extinctions and recolonizations of demes by the offspring of few immigrants.",slave rebellion is not costly and may be a side effect of a beneficial trait. ,Temnothorax longispinosus,ants,Insecta,simulation models,,"enslaved Temnothorax longispinosus ant workers rebel agains their social parasite Temnothorax americanus.

Relationships among traits may facilitate or constrain evolutionary responses to selection, depending on whether the direction of selection is aligned or opposed to the pattern of trait correlations. Attempts to predict evolutionary potential in correlated traits generally assume that correlations are stable across time and space; however, increasing evidence suggests that this may not be the case, and flexibility in trait correlations could bias evolutionary trajectories. We examined genetic and environmental influences on variation and covariation in a suite of behavioural traits to understand if and how flexibility in trait correlations influences adaptation to novel environments. We tested the role of genetic and environmental influences on behavioural trait correlations by comparing Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) historically adapted to high-and low-predation environments that were reared under native and non-native environmental conditions. Both high-and low-predation fish exhibited increased behavioural variance when reared under non-native vs. native environmental conditions, and rearing in the non-native environment shifted the major axis of variation among behaviours.

PCSK6 activates Nodal, a morphogen involved in regulating left-right body axis determination. Therefore, the GWAS data suggest that the biology underlying the patterning of structural asymmetries may also contribute to behavioural laterality, e.g. handedness. The association is further supported by an independent study reporting a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) within the same PCSK6 locus to be associated with degree of handedness in a general population cohort. Here, we have conducted a functional analysis of the PCSK6 locus combining further genetic analysis, in silico predictions and molecular assays. We have shown that the previous GWAS signal was not tagging a VNTR effect, suggesting that the two markers have independent effects. We demonstrated experimentally that one of the top GWAS-associated markers, rs11855145, directly alters the binding site for a nuclear factor.

However, heritability estimation based on the classical twin models does not take into account dynamic behavior of the variance components over age. Varying variance of the genetic component over age can imply the existence of gene-environment (G x E) interactions that general genome-wide association studies (GWAS) fail to capture, which may lead to the inconsistency of heritability estimates between twin design and GWAS. Existing parametric G x E interaction models for twin studies are limited by assuming a linear or quadratic form of the variance curves with respect to a moderator that can, however, be overly restricted in reality. Here we propose spline-based approaches to explore the variance curves of the genetic and environmental components. We choose the additive genetic, common, and unique environmental variance components (ACE) model as the starting point. We treat the component variances as variance functions with respect to age modeled by B-splines or P-splines. We develop an empirical Bayes method to estimate the variance curves together with their confidence bands and provide an R package for public use. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods accurately capture dynamic behavior of the component variances in terms of mean square errors with a data set of >10,000 twin pairs. Using the proposed methods as an alternative and major extension to the classical twin models, our analyses with a large-scale Finnish twin data set (19,510 MZ twins and 27,312 DZ same-sex twins) discover that the variances of the A, C, and E components for body mass index (BMI) change substantially across life span in different patterns and the heritability of BMI drops to approximate to 50% after middle age. The results further indicate that the decline of heritability is due to increasing unique environmental variance, which provides more insights into age-specific heritability of BMI and evidence of G x E interactions. These findings highlight the fundamental importance and implication of the proposed models in facilitating twin studies to investigate the heritability specific to age and other modifying factors.",not behavior,humans,,,a new Bayesian GWAS for twin studies that incorporates variance componens over age,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Cooke, Lucy   Wardle, Jane   Llewellyn, Clare H.", Common genetic architecture underlying young children's food fussiness   and liking for vegetables and fruit,103,2016," Background: Food fussiness (FF) is common in early childhood and is often associated with the rejection of nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables and fruit. FF and liking for vegetables and fruit are likely all heritable phenotypes; the genetic influence underlying FF may explain the observed genetic influence on liking for vegetables and fruit. Twin analyses make it possible to get a broad-based estimate of the extent of the shared genetic influence that underlies these traits.   Objective: We quantified the extent of the shared genetic influence that underlies FF and liking for vegetables and fruit in early childhood with the use of a twin design.   Design: Data were from the Gemini cohort, which is a population-based sample of twins born in England and Wales in 2007. Parents of 3-y-old twins (n = 1330 pairs) completed questionnaire measures of their children's food preferences (liking for vegetables and fruit) and the FF scale from the Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Multivariate quantitative genetic modeling was used to estimate common genetic influences that underlie FF and liking for vegetables and fruit.   Results: Genetic correlations were significant and moderate to large in size between FF and liking for both vegetables (20.65) and fruit (20.43), which indicated that a substantial proportion of the genes that influence FF also influence liking.

Morand-Ferron, Julie", Environmental and genetic determinants of innovativeness in a natural   population of birds,371,2016," Much of the evidence for the idea that individuals differ in their propensity to innovate and solve new problems has come from studies on captive primates. Increasingly, behavioural ecologists are studying innovativeness in wild populations, and uncovering links with functional behaviour and fitness related traits. The relative importance of genetic and environmental factors in driving this variation, however, remains unknown. Here, we present the results of the first large-scale study to examine a range of causal factors underlying innovative problem-solving performance (PSP) among 831 great tits (Parus major) temporarily taken into captivity. Analyses show that PSP in this population: (i) was linked to a variety of individual factors, including age, personality and natal origin (immigrant or local-born); (ii) was influenced by natal environment, because individuals had a lower PSP when born in poor-quality habitat, or where local population density was high, leading to cohort effects. Links with many of the individual and environmental factors were present only in some years. In addition, PSP (iii) had little or no measurable heritability, as estimated by a Bayesian animal model; and (iv) was not influenced by maternal effects. Despite previous reports of links between PSP and a range of functional traits in this population, the analyses here suggest that innovativeness had weak if any evolutionary potential. Instead most individual variation was caused by phenotypic plasticity driven by links with other behavioural traits and by environmentally mediated developmental stress. Heritability estimates are population, time and context specific, however, and more studies are needed to determine the generality of these effects. Our results shed light on the causes of innovativeness within populations, and add to the debate on the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors in driving phenotypic variation within populations.","problem-solving performance was not heritable or influenced by maternal effects, but was linked to age, personality, natal origin, and natal environment.",Parus major,great tits,Aves,study of 831 individuals taken into captivity,pedigree,example of non-heritable behavior and no maternal effects,maybe,x,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,x,not human

In German cockroach (Blattella germanica L.) populations, glucose aversion has evolved rapidly in response to glucose-containing insecticidal baits, but little is known about the consequences of this behaviour in the absence of bait. In the present study, glucose-averse (GA) and wild-type (WT) male German cockroaches are restricted to a range of nutritionally defined diets containing either glucose or fructose as the sole carbohydrate source, and time to first expression of courtship is measured by stimulating the male antennae daily with isolated antennae from receptive, 6-day-old females. Glucose-averse males that are restricted to glucose-containing diets mature their courtship responses significantly later than GA males restricted to fructose-containing diets, whereas there is no difference in maturation of courtship responses between GA males restricted to fructose-containing diets and WT males restricted to diets containing either sugar type. Glucose-averse males furthermore respond later to GA female antennae than to WT female antennae, all from 6-day-old females. This suggests that GA females are less sexually stimulating, and the results are also consistent with earlier findings showing that GA females contain less developed oocytes than WT females at this age. These findings demonstrate that an adaptive gustatory mutation conferring protection from a toxin may have comparatively detrimental effects under conditions where the toxin has vanished, both by delaying female sexual maturation and signalling and by delaying male sexual maturation and courtship under conditions where glucose is a major energy source.",glucose aversion 9adaptive to avoid traps) has detrimental effects when males are rased on glucose-only diet by delaying reproductive maturity. glucose aversion females are also less sexually stimulating than WT. ,Blattella germanica,German cockroach,Insecta,experimentally raised males on different diets and exposed them to female antennae,selection experiment,not exactly quantitative genetics but good example of tradeoffs,maybe,,x,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY," Childs, DZ   Sheldon, BC   Rees, MAF Childs, Dylan Z.   Sheldon, Ben C.   Rees, Mark", The evolution of labile traits in sex- and age-structured populations,85,2016," Many quantitative traits are labile (e.g. somatic growth rate, reproductive timing and investment), varying over the life cycle as a result of behavioural adaptation, developmental processes and plastic responses to the environment. At the population level, selection can alter the distribution of such traits across age classes and among generations. Despite a growing body of theoretical research exploring the evolutionary dynamics of labile traits, a data-driven framework for incorporating such traits into demographic models has not yet been developed. Integral projection models (IPMs) are increasingly being used to understand the interplay between changes in labile characters, life histories and population dynamics. One limitation of the IPM approach is that it relies on phenotypic associations between parents and offspring traits to capture inheritance. However, it is well-established that many different processes may drive these associations, and currently, no clear consensus has emerged on how to model micro-evolutionary dynamics in an IPM framework. We show how to embed quantitative genetic models of inheritance of labile traits into age-structured, two-sex models that resemble standard IPMs. Commonly used statistical tools such as GLMs and their mixed model counterparts can then be used for model parameterization. We illustrate the methodology through development of a simple model of egg-laying date evolution, parameterized using data from a population of Great tits (Parus major). We demonstrate how our framework can be used to project the joint dynamics of species' traits and population density. We then develop a simple extension of the age-structured Price equation(ASPE) for two-sex populations, and apply this to examine the age-specific contributions of different processes to change in the mean phenotype and breeding value. The data-driven framework we outline here has the potential to facilitate greater insight into the nature of selection and its consequences in settings where focal traits vary over the lifetime through ontogeny, behavioural adaptation and phenotypic plasticity, as well as providing a potential bridge between theoretical and empirical studies of labile trait variation.","embed quantitative genetic models of inheritance of labile traits into age-structured two-sex models, parameterized using data to model egg-laying date evolution",Parus major,great tits,Aves,developed a new method,pedigree,"relevant method, but not great example",Probably no,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

The expression of AGP and CRP mRNA was found to be increased in animals slaughtered after road transport. The presence of AGP protein was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The results of this study showed that road-transport may induce the mRNA expression of immune related proteins.

Salience and valence of stimuli sensed through neurosensors, chemosensors and immunosensors are perceived and integrated centrally to generate emotions and engage physiological, behavioural, immune, cognitive and morphological responses that defend against noxious challenges. These responses can be refined through experience to provide anticipatory and learned reactions at lower cost than innate less-specific reactions. Influences of behaviour type, coping style, and affective state and the relationships between immune responsiveness, disease resistance and resilience are reviewed. We define resilience as the capacity of animals to cope with short-term perturbations in their environment and return rapidly to their pre-challenge status. It is manifested in response to episodic, sporadic or situation-specific attributes of the environment and can be optimised via facultative learning by the individual. It is a comparative measure of differences between individuals in the outcomes that follow exposure to potentially adverse situations. In contrast, robustness is the capacity to maintain productivity in a wide range of environments without compromising reproduction, health and wellbeing. Robustness is manifested in response to persistent or cyclical attributes of the environment and is effected via activity of innate regulatory pathways. We suggest that for farm animals, husbandry practices that incorporate physical and social stressors and interactions with humans such as weaning, change of housing, and introduction to the milking parlour can be used to characterise resilience phenotypes. In these settings, resilience is likely to be more readily identified through the rate of return of variables to pre-challenge or normal status rather than through measuring the activity of diverse stress response and adaptation mechanisms. Our strategy for phenotyping resilience of sheep and cattle during weaning is described. Opportunities are examined to increase resilience through genetic selection and through improved management practices that provide emotional and cognitive enrichment and stress inoculation.",outline strategy for phenotyping resilience,Bos taurus and Ovis,farm animals,Mammalia,phenotype during everyday interactions with humans,pedigree,not relevant,no,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Despite the many challenges posed by the high level of biological and social complexity, a long lifespan and difficult access in the field, genetic studies of primates are particularly rewarding because of the close evolutionary relatedness of these species to humans. The free-ranging rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) population on Cayo Santiago (CS), Puerto Rico, provides a unique resource in this respect because several of the abovementioned caveats are of either minor importance there, or lacking altogether, thereby allowing long-term genetic research in a primate population under constant surveillance since 1956. This review summarizes more than 40 years of genetic research carried out on CS, from early blood group typing and the genetic characterization of skeletal material via population-wide paternity testing with DNA fingerprints and short tandem repeats (STRs) to the analysis of the highly polymorphic DQB1 locus within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The results of the paternity studies also facilitated subsequent studies of male dominance and other factors influencing male reproductive success, of male reproductive skew, paternal kin bias, and mechanisms of paternal kin recognition. More recently, the CS macaques have been the subjects of functional genetic and gene expression analyses and have played an important role in behavioral and quantitative genetic studies. In addition, the CS colony has been used as a natural model for human adult-onset macular degeneration, glaucoma, and circadian rhythm disorder.

However, knowledge about the quantitative genetic basis of behavioural syndromes, and the stability and evolvability of genetic correlations under different ecological conditions, is limited. We investigated the quantitative genetic basis of correlated behaviours in the freshwater isopod Asellus aquaticus. In some Swedish lakes, A.aquaticus has recently colonized a novel habitat and diverged into two ecotypes, presumably due to habitat-specific selection from predation. Using a common garden approach and animal model analyses, we estimated quantitative genetic parameters for behavioural traits and compared the genetic architecture between the ecotypes. We report that the genetic covariance structure of the behavioural traits has been altered in the novel ecotype, demonstrating divergence in behavioural correlations. Thus, our study confirms that genetic correlations behind behaviours can change rapidly in response to novel selective environments.","genetic basis of correlated behaviors, and report that the genetic covariance structure of the behavioral traits has been altered i the novel ecotype",Asellus aquaticus,isopod,Malacostraca,common garden and animal model analyses,common-garden,"definitely read, excellent example",yes,x,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Tomkins, Joseph L.", Investigating the genetic architecture of conditional strategies using   the environmental threshold model,282,2015," The threshold expression of dichotomous phenotypes that are environmentally cued or induced comprise the vast majority of phenotypic dimorphisms in colour, morphology, behaviour and life history. Modelled as conditional strategies under the framework of evolutionary game theory, the quantitative genetic basis of these traits is a challenge to estimate. The challenge exists firstly because the phenotypic expression of the trait is dichotomous and secondly because the apparent environmental cue is separate from the biological signal pathway that induces the switch between phenotypes. It is the cryptic variation underlying the translation of cue to phenotype that we address here. With a 'half-sib common environment' and a 'family-level split environment' experiment, we examine the environmental and genetic influences that underlie male dimorphism in the earwig Forficula auricularia. From the conceptual framework of the latent environmental threshold (LET) model, we use pedigree information to dissect the genetic architecture of the threshold expression of forceps length. We investigate for the first time the strength of the correlation between observable and cryptic 'proximate' cues. Furthermore, in support of the environmental threshold model, we found no evidence for a genetic correlation between cue and the threshold between phenotypes. Our results show strong correlations between observable and proximate cues and less genetic variation for thresholds than previous studies have suggested. We discuss the importance of generating better estimates of the genetic variation for thresholds when investigating the genetic architecture and heritability of threshold traits. By investigating genetic architecture by means of the LET model, our study supports several key evolutionary ideas related to conditional strategies and improves our understanding of environmentally cued decisions.","strong correlation between observable and proximate cues and less genetic variation or thresholds , in genetic threshold model - not behavior",Forficula auricularia,earwig,Insecta,use latent environmental threshold model and pedigree information,pedigree,sounds like a potentially good example,yes,,,x,,,,,,,,x,,,x,,,,not human

The pattern of high shared environmentality, especially for twins, is not accounted for by the strong degree of assortative mating in the data (parental correlation r = .629), nor by direct effects of educational attainment of the siblings on each other. The low heritability-high environmentality pattern indicates a high level of inequality of opportunity for educational attainment in American society at the turn of the twenty-first century, perhaps linked to a greater role of family financial resources in attainment.

H.", Selection on bristle length has the ability to drive the evolution of   male abdominal appendages in the sepsid fly Themira biloba,28,2015," Many exaggerated and novel traits are strongly influenced by sexual selection. Although sexual selection is a powerful evolutionary force, underlying genetic interactions can constrain evolutionary outcomes. The relative strength of selection vs. constraint has been a matter of debate for the evolution of male abdominal appendages in sepsid flies. These abdominal appendages are involved in courtship and mating, but their function has not been directly tested. We performed mate choice experiments to determine whether sexual selection acts on abdominal appendages in the sepsid Themira biloba. We tested whether appendage bristle length influenced successful insemination by surgically trimming the bristles. Females paired with males that had shortened bristles laid only unfertilized eggs, indicating that long bristles are necessary for successful insemination. We also tested whether the evolution of bristle length was constrained by phenotypic correlations with other traits. Analyses of phenotypic covariation indicated that bristle length was highly correlated with other abdominal appendage traits, but was not correlated with abdominal sternite size. Thus, abdominal appendages are not exaggerated traits like many sexual ornaments, but vary independently from body size. At the same time, strong correlations between bristle length and appendage length suggest that selection on bristle length is likely to result in a correlated increase in appendage length. Bristle length is under sexual selection in T.biloba and has the potential to evolve independently from abdomen size.","mate choice to determine whether sexual selection acts on abdominal appendages, found bristle length was highly correlated with other abdominal appendage traits.  - not behavior",Themira biloba,sepsid fly,Insecta,mate choice experiments,phenotypes,not really behaviors,probably no,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Based on these findings, studies that fail to use genetically informed modeling strategies risk model misspecification and biased parameter estimates. Twin- and adoption-based research designs have frequently been used to overcome this limitation. Despite the many advantages of such approaches, many available datasets do not contain samples of twins, siblings or adoptees, making it impossible to utilize these modeling strategies. The current study proposes a measurement strategy for estimating the intergenerational transmission of antisocial behavior (ASB) within a nationally representative sample of singletons using an extended pedigree risk approach that relies on information from first- and second-degree relatives. An evaluation of this approach revealed a pattern of findings that directly aligned with studies examining ASB using more traditional twin- and adoption-based research designs. While the proposed pedigree risk approach is not capable of effectively isolating genetic and environmental influences, this overall alignment in results provides tentative evidence suggesting that the proposed pedigree risk measure effectively captures genetic influences. Future replication studies are necessary as this observation remains preliminary. Whenever possible, more traditional quantitative genetic methodologies should be favored, but the presented strategy remains a viable alternative for more limited samples.","intergenerational transmission of antisocial behavior using extended pedigree risk approach using first and second degree relatives, shows an overall alignment to show that this measure effectively captures genetic influences",humans,,,testing a new analysis method using pedigree risk approach,,"mostly about the method, not a great example",no,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,x,human

Jiang et al. show that in cases of ATM deficiency, dysfunction of the translocator protein TET1 leads to Purkinje cell-specific alterations in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)-mediated epigenetic regulation.A long-standing mystery surrounding ataxia-telangiectasia is why it is mainly cerebellar neurons, Purkinje cells in particular, that appear vulnerable to ATM deficiency. Here we present data showing that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a newly recognized epigenetic marker found at high levels in neurons, is substantially reduced in human ataxia-telangiectasia and Atm(-/-) mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells. We further show that TET1, an enzyme that converts 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5hmC, responds to DNA damage and manipulation of TET1 activity directly affects the DNA damage signalling and ATM-deficient neuronal cell cycle re-entry and death. Quantitative genome-wide analysis of 5hmC-containing sequences shows that in ATM deficiency there is a cerebellum- and Purkinje cell-specific shift in 5hmC enrichment in both regulatory elements and repeated sequences. Finally, we verify that TET1-mediated 5hmC production is linked to the degenerative process of Purkinje cells and behavioural deficits in Atm(-/-) mice.

Previous research has found that genetic influences on rule-breaking, but not aggression, increase from late childhood to mid-adolescence. This study tested the extent to which the developmental increase in genetic influence on rule-breaking was associated with pubertal development compared to chronological age. Method: Child and adolescent twins (n = 1,031), ranging in age from 8 to 20 years (M age = 13.5 years), were recruited from public schools as part of the Texas Twin Project. Participants reported on their pubertal development using the Pubertal Development Scale and on their involvement in ASB on items from the Child Behavior Checklist. Measurement invariance of ASB subtypes across age groups (= 12 years vs. > 12 years old) was tested using confirmatory factor analyses. Quantitative genetic modeling was used to test whether the genetic and environmental influences on aggression and rule-breaking were moderated by age, pubertal status, or both. Results: Quantitative genetic modeling indicated that genetic influences specific to rule-breaking increased as a function of pubertal development controlling for age (a gene 9 puberty interaction), but did not vary as a function of age controlling for pubertal status. There were no developmental differences in the genetic etiology of aggression. Family-level environmental influences common to aggression and rule-breaking decreased with age, further contributing to the differentiation between these subtypes of ASB from childhood to adolescence.

This study explores patterns of inheritance, diet, age, and mate-choice copying on the expression of male sexual signals and associated female mate choice in a phenotypically diverse group of Schizo-cosa wolf spiders. Focal spiders exhibit one of two male phenotypes: 'ornamented' males possess large black brushes on their forelegs, and 'non-ornamented' males possess no brushes. Using a quantitative genetics breeding design in a mixed population of ornamented/non-ornamented males, we found a strong genetic basis to male phenotype and female choice. We also found that some ornamented males produced some sons with large brushes and others with barely visible brushes. Results of diet manipulations and behavioral mating trials showed no influence of diet on male phenotype or female mate choice. Age post maturation, however, influenced mate choice, with younger females being more likely to mate with ornamented males. A mate-choice copying experiment found that, following observations of another female's mate choice/copulation, virgin mature females tended to match the mate choice (ornamented vs. non-ornamented males) of the females they observed. Finally, analyses of genetic variation across phenotypically pure (only one male phenotype present) vs. mixed (both phenotypes present) populations revealed genetic distinction between phenotypes in phenotypically-pure populations, but no distinctionin phenotypically-mixed populations. The difference in patterns of genetic differentiation and mating across geographic locations suggests a complex network of factors contributing to the outcome of sexual selection.","found a strong genetic basis to male phenotype and female choice, with no influence of diet but an influence of age in females.

Several evolutionary hypotheses regarding the maintenance of this variation have been proposed, but they all rest on the relatively untested question of whether this variation has a genetic basis and if so, exactly what genetic mechanisms may be involved. We tested for heritability and the effects of heterozygosity on two measures of parental care behavior (nestling provisioning rate and the likelihood of provisioning with large food items) in a population of wild house sparrows (Passer domesticus), where both behaviors display consistent individual differences across a wide range of contexts. We found no evidence of significant heritability in either measure of parental care behavior. However, in a subset of 46 female sparrows, the likelihood of bringing large food items to the nest, but not provisioning rate, was positively correlated with genetic heterozygosity estimated from 18 polymorphic microsatellite markers. Despite these findings, individual identity continued to explain a significant proportion of the variation in parental care behavior. Our results imply that while the effects of directional selection on traits associated with parental care may be limited in this population, genetic heterozygosity appears to play a role in the maintenance of phenotypic diversity in at least one aspect of parental care behavior.","no heritability in parental care behaviors (provisioning rates and likelihood of providing large food items), but in a subset of females likelihood of large food items was positively correlated with genetic heterozygosity.

Genetic influences contribute significantly to co-morbidity between conduct disorder and substance use disorders. Estimating the extent of overlap can assist in the development of phenotypes for genomic analyses.   Method. Multivariate quantitative genetic analyses were conducted using data from 9577 individuals, including 3982 complete twin pairs and 1613 individuals whose co-twin was not interviewed (aged 24-37 years) from two Australian twin samples. Analyses examined the genetic correlation between alcohol dependence, nicotine dependence and cannabis abuse/dependence and the extent to which the correlations were attributable to genetic influences shared with conduct disorder.   Results. Additive genetic (a(2) = 0.48-0.65) and non-shared environmental factors explained variance in substance use disorders. Familial effects on conduct disorder were due to additive genetic (a(2) = 0.39) and shared environmental (c(2) = 0.15) factors. All substance use disorders were influenced by shared genetic factors (r(g) = 0.38-0.56), with all genetic overlap between substances attributable to genetic influences shared with conduct disorder. Genes influencing individual substance use disorders were also significant, explaining 40-73% of the genetic variance per substance.   Conclusions. Among substance users in this sample, the well-documented clinical co-morbidity between conduct disorder and substance use disorders is primarily attributable to shared genetic liability. Interventions targeted at generally reducing deviant behaviors may address the risk posed by this shared genetic liability. However, there is also evidence for genetic and environmental influences specific to each substance.

Dochtermann, Ned A.", Integrating molecular mechanisms into quantitative genetics to   understand consistent individual differences in behavior,6,2015," It is now well appreciated that individual animals behave differently from one another and that individual differences in behaviors - personality differences - are maintained through time and across situations. Quantitative genetics has emerged as a conceptual basis for understanding the key ingredients of personality: (co) variation and plasticity. However, the results from quantitative genetic analyses are often divorced from underlying molecular or other proximate mechanisms. This disconnect has the potential to impede an integrated understanding of behavior and is a disconnect present throughout evolutionary ecology. Here we discuss some of the main conceptual connections between personality and quantitative genetics, the relationship of both with genomic tools, and areas that require integration. With its consideration of both trait variation and plasticity, the study of animal personality offers new opportunities to incorporate molecular mechanisms into both the trait partitioning and reaction norm frameworks provided by quantitative genetics.",co variation and plasticity are the key ingredients of personality. discuss main conceptual connections between personality and quantiative genetics. highlight possibility of reaction norm frameworks,,,,review,,could be worth reading to help frame my article,yes,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,not human

To enable quantitative genetic analysis of such a unique organism, we developed a new model called the Reference Gene Model, and used it to conduct large-scale transcriptome analysis.

Recent studies have revealed that mating can alter starvation resistance in female D. melanogaster, but little is known about the behavioral and physiological mechanisms underlying such mating-mediated changes in starvation resistance. In the present study, we first investigated whether the effect of mating on starvation resistance is sex-specific in D. melanogaster. As indicated by a significant sex x mating status interaction, mating increased starvation resistance in females but not in males. In female D. melanogaster, post-mating increase in starvation resistance was mainly attributed to increases in food intake and in the level of lipid storage relative to lean body weight. We then performed quantitative genetic analysis to estimate the proportion of the total phenotypic variance attributable to genetic differences (i.e., heritability) for starvation resistance in mated male and female D. melanogaster. The narrow-sense heritability (h(2)) of starvation resistance was 0.235 and 0.155 for males and females, respectively. Mated females were more resistant to starvation than males in all genotypes, but the degree of such sexual dimorphism varied substantially among genotypes, as indicated by a significant sex x genotype interaction for starvation resistance. Cross-sex genetic correlation was greater than 0 but less than I for starvation resistance, implying that the genetic architecture of this trait was partially shared between the two sexes. For both sexes, starvation resistance was positively correlated with longevity and lipid storage at genetic level. The present study suggests that sex differences in starvation resistance depend on mating status and have a genetic basis in D. melanogaster. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To begin examining the generality of this finding in other groups of squamates, we measured maximal sprint running speed on a high-speed treadmill and endurance at 1.0 km/h (0.28 m/s) in 14 species of North American phrynosomatid lizards, plus a sample of nine additional species to encompass some of the broadscale diversity of lizards. We used both conventional and phylogenetically informed regression analyses to control for some known causes of performance variation (body size, stockiness, body temperature) and then computed residual performance values.

Yet, to fully understand how personality traits may respond to selection, one must understand the underlying heritability and genetic correlations between traits. Previous studies have reported a moderate degree of heritability of personality traits, but few of these studies have either been conducted in the wild or estimated the genetic correlations between personality traits. Estimating the additive genetic variance and covariance in the wild is crucial to understand the evolutionary potential of behavioural traits. Enhanced environmental variation could reduce heritability and genetic correlations, thus leading to different evolutionary predictions. We estimated the additive genetic variance and covariance of docility in the trap, sociability (mirror image stimulation), and exploration and activity in two different contexts (open-field and mirror image simulation experiments) in a wild population of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris). We estimated both heritability of behaviours and of personality traits and found nonzero additive genetic variance in these traits. We also found nonzero maternal, permanent environment and year effects. Finally, we found four phenotypic correlations between traits, and one positive genetic correlation between activity in the open-field test and sociability. We also found permanent environment correlations between activity in both tests and docility and exploration in the MIS test. This is one of a handful of studies to adopt a quantitative genetic approach to explain variation in personality traits in the wild and, thus, provides important insights into the potential variance available for selection.","estimated heritability of behaviors and personality trits and found nonzero additive genetic variance in these traits. found four phenotypic correlations between traits, one positive genetic correlation and permanent environmetnal correlations",Marmota flaviventris,yellow-bellied marmots,Mammalia,used a wild population,relatedness,good example,yes,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,not human

Here, we analyzed genetic contributions to single-trial, long-term social and nonsocial recognition and subsequently studied the functional impact of an identified candidate gene on behavioral development.   METHODS: Genetic mapping of single-trial social recognition was performed in chromosome substitution strains, a sophisticated tool for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) of complex traits. Follow-up occurred by generating and testing knockout (KO) mice of a selected QTL candidate gene. Functional characterization of these mice was performed through behavioral and neurological assessments across developmental stages and analyses of gene expression and brain morphology.   RESULTS: Chromosome substitution strain 14 mapping studies revealed an overlapping QTL related to long-term social and object recognition harboring Pcdh9, a cell-adhesion gene previously associated with autism spectrum disorder. Specific long-term social and object recognition deficits were confirmed in homozygous (KO) Pcdh9-deficient mice, while heterozygous mice only showed long-term social recognition impairment. The recognition deficits in KO mice were not associated with alterations in perception, multi-trial discrimination learning, sociability, behavioral flexibility, or fear memory. Rather, KO mice showed additional impairments in sensorimotor development reflected by early touch-evoked biting, rotarod performance, and sensory gating deficits. This profile emerged with structural changes in deep layers of sensory cortices, where Pcdh9 is selectively expressed.   CONCLUSIONS: This behavior-to-gene study implicates Pcdh9 in cognitive functions required for long-term social and nonsocial recognition.

In a selection experiment, two lines were developed for 11 generations for high (HFP) and low (LFP) feather pecking, respectively. Starting with the second generation of selection, there was a constant difference in mean number of FP bouts between both lines. We used the data from this experiment to perform a quantitative genetic analysis and to map selection signatures.   Methods: Pedigree and phenotypic data were available for the last six generations of both lines. Univariate quantitative genetic analyses were conducted using mixed linear and generalized mixed linear models assuming a Poisson distribution. Selection signatures were mapped using 33,228 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped on 41 HFP and 34 LFP individuals of generation 11. For each SNP, we estimated Wright's fixation index (F-ST). We tested the null hypothesis that F-ST is driven purely by genetic drift against the alternative hypothesis that it is driven by genetic drift and selection.   Results: The mixed linear model failed to analyze the LFP data because of the large number of 0s in the observation vector. The Poisson model fitted the data well and revealed a small but continuous genetic trend in both lines. Most of the 17 genome-wide significant SNPs were located on chromosomes 3 and 4. Thirteen clusters with at least two significant SNPs within an interval of 3 Mb maximum were identified. Two clusters were mapped on chromosomes 3, 4, 8 and 19. Of the 17 genome-wide significant SNPs, 12 were located within the identified clusters. This indicates a non-random distribution of significant SNPs and points to the presence of selection sweeps.   Conclusions: Data on FP should be analysed using generalised linear mixed models assuming a Poisson distribution, especially if the number of FP bouts is small and the distribution is heavily peaked at 0.

Excess food consumption in people is associated with obesity and metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. However, little is known about the genetic basis of natural variation in food consumption. To gain insights in evolutionarily conserved genetic principles that regulate food intake, we took advantage of a model system, Drosophila melanogaster, in which food intake, environmental conditions and genetic background can be controlled precisely. We quantified variation in food intake among 182 inbred, sequenced lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). We found significant genetic variation in the mean and within-line environmental variance of food consumption and observed sexual dimorphism and genetic variation in sexual dimorphism for both food intake traits (mean and variance). We performed genome wide association (GWA) analyses for mean food intake and environmental variance of food intake (using the coefficient of environmental variation, CVE, as the metric for environmental variance) and identified molecular polymorphisms associated with both traits. Validation experiments using RNAi-knockdown confirmed 24 of 31 (77%) candidate genes affecting food intake and/or variance of food intake, and a test cross between selected DGRP lines confirmed a SNP affecting mean food intake identified in the GWA analysis.

While there has been an impressive marshalling of evidence for diverse forms of nongenetic inheritance (epigenetic, ecological, behavioural and symbolic), there have been relatively few studies trying to integrate the different forms of inheritance into a common conceptual structure, a development that would be important to formalize elements of the extended evolutionary synthesis. Here, we propose a framework for an extended view of inheritance and introduce some conceptual distinctions that we believe, are important to this issue. In this framework, the phenotype is conceived of as a dynamic entity, its state, at any point in time resulting from intertwined effects of previous phenotypic state, and of hereditary materials (DNA and otherwise) and environment. We contrast our framework with the standard gene-based view of inheritance, and also discuss our framework in the specific context of recent attempts to accommodate nongenetic inheritance within the framework of classical quantitative genetics and the Price equation. In particular, we believe that the extended view of inheritance and effects on the phenotype developed here is particularly well-suited to individual-based simulation studies of evolutionary dynamics. The results of such simulations, in turn, could be useful for assessing, how well extended models based on quantitative genetics or the Price equation perform at capturing complex evolutionary dynamics.",extended view of inheritance and effects on phenotype developed here --> enhanced evolutionary synthesis,review,,,,,a bit tangential but possibly good for a box,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

The presence of age-related plasticity in behavior opens up the possibility of between-individual variation in age-related plasticity (Individual-Age interaction, IxA) and genotype-age interaction (GxA). We outline the available approaches for quantifying GxA. We underline that knowledge of GxA for behaviors is an important step in reaching and understanding of the evolution of plasticity in behavior over lifetime. In particular, the heritability (repeatability) and/or the rank order of behavior across individuals are predicted to change across ages in presence of GxA. We draw on the theory of reaction norms to illustrate that GxA, when present, is likely to lead to developmental changes in the magnitude and possibly sign of the genetic correlation between behaviors (behavioral syndrome). We present an overview of the literature on changes in the ranking of individuals' behavior across ages, and in the correlation between behaviors. Although all studies were carried out on the phenotypic level, they overall suggest clear scope for increased study of GxA as a process explaining age-related plasticity in behaviors. Lastly, we throughout emphasize that many of the approaches and underlying theory of GxA is applicable to the study of IxA, which is informative as it presents the upper limit of GxA, but is also a more attainable target of study in many systems.

Interspecific hybridization has the potential to alter behavioral trait correlations, but the effect of hybridization on suites of behavioral traits has received relatively little attention. We evaluated how natural hybridization changes the relationship between boldness (time of emergence and proportion of time out of shelter) and response to a simulated predator threat in swordtails (Teleostei: Xiphophorus). In poeciliid fishes, bold individuals have increased survival in the presence of predators. This non-intuitive observation may arise as a result of bold individuals being more likely to engage in anti-predator behaviors. Contrary to our prediction, bold individuals were less likely to perform a fast-start response to a predator threat. This correlation was consistent among populations and species but was only significant in hybrids. The observed correlation between boldness and anti-predator behavior could impact hybrid fitness and the evolvability of hybrid lineages. More generally, our findings suggest that hybridization could influence the integration of behavioral phenotypes, as has been amply documented for morphology.

Competing females can exhibit morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations typical of males, which are commonly considered as secondary sexual traits. Competition and the development of traits increasing competitiveness require much energy and may exert adverse effects on fecundity and survival. From an evolutionary perspective, positive selection for increased competitiveness would then result in evolution of reduced values for traits related to fitness such as fecundity and survival. There is recent evidence for such evolutionary trade-offs involving male competition, but no study has considered competing females so far. Using data from competitions for dominance in cows (Bos taurus), we found negative genetic correlations between traits providing success in competition, that is, fighting ability and fitness traits related to milk production and with fertility (the inverse of parity-conception interval). Fighting ability also showed low but positive genetic correlations with masculine morphological traits, and negative correlations with feminine traits.

Relatively little is known about the genetic and neuronal mechanisms contributing to diversity of behavior in natural populations. By studying intraspecies variation in innate avoidance behavior to thermal stimuli in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we uncovered genetic principles of how different components of a behavioral response can be altered in nature to generate behavioral diversity. Using a thermal pulse assay, we uncovered heritable variation in responses to a transient temperature increase. Quantitative trait locus mapping revealed that separate components of this response were controlled by distinct genomic loci. The loci we identified contributed to variation in components of thermal pulse avoidance behavior in an additive fashion. Our results show that the escape behavior induced by thermal stimuli is composed of simpler behavioral components that are influenced by at least six distinct genetic loci. The loci that decouple components of the escape behavior reveal a genetic system that allows independent modification of behavioral parameters.

 J, JOURNAL OF HUMAN EVOLUTION," Grabowski, M   Roseman, CCAF Grabowski, Mark   Roseman, Charles C.", Complex and changing patterns of natural selection explain the evolution   of the human hip,85,2015," Causal explanations for the dramatic changes that occurred during the evolution of the human hip focus largely on selection for bipedal function and locomotor efficiency. These hypotheses rest on two critical assumptions. The first that these anatomical changes served functional roles in bipedalism has been supported in numerous analyses showing how postcranial changes likely affected locomotion. The second that morphological changes that did play functional roles in bipedalism were the result of selection for that behavior has not been previously explored and represents a major gap in our understanding of hominin hip evolution. Here we use evolutionary quantitative genetic models to test the hypothesis that strong directional selection on many individual aspects of morphology was responsible for the large differences observed across a sample of fossil hominin hips spanning the Plio-Pleistocene. Our approach uses covariance among traits and the differences between relatively complete fossils to estimate the net selection pressures that drove the major transitions in hominin hip evolution. Our findings show a complex and changing pattern of natural selection drove hominin hip evolution, and that many, but not all, traits hypothesized to play functional roles in bipedalism evolved as a direct result of natural selection. While the rate of evolutionary change for all transitions explored here does not exceed the amount expected if evolution was occurring solely through neutral processes, it was far above rates of evolution for morphological traits in other mammalian groups. Given that stasis is the norm in the mammalian fossil record, our results suggest that large shifts in the adaptive landscape drove hominin evolution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The sample consisted of 100 families covering three generations from Portugal. PA and SB were assessed via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form (IPAQ-SF). Sex-specific effects were assessed by genotype-by-sex interaction (GSI) models and sex-specific heritabilities. GSI effects and heterogeneity were tested in the residual environmental variance. SPSS 17 and SOLAR v. 4.1 were used in all computations.   Results: The genetic component for PA and SB domains varied from low to moderate (11 % to 46 %), when analyzing both genders combined. We found GSI effects for vigorous PA (p = 0.02) and time spent watching television (WT) (p < 0.001) that showed significantly higher additive genetic variance estimates in males. The heterogeneity in the residual environmental variance was significant for moderate PA (p = 0.02), vigorous PA (p = 0.006) and total PA (p = 0.001). Sex-specific heritability estimates were significantly higher in males only for WT, with a male-to-female difference in heritability of 42.5 (95 % confidence interval: 6.4, 70.4).

This hierarchy produces some fundamental challenges to clearly defining biological phenomena and constructing a consistent explanatory framework. We use a heuristic statistical model to explore two consequences of this hierarchy. First, although the variation existing among individuals within populations has long been of interest to evolutionary biologists, within-individual variation has been much less emphasized. Within-individual variance occurs when labile phenotypes (behaviour, physiology, and sometimes morphology) exhibit phenotypic plasticity or deviate from a norm-of-reaction within the same individual. A statistical partitioning of phenotypic variance leads us to explore an array of ideas about residual within-individual variation. We use this approach to draw attention to additional processes that may influence within-individual phenotypic variance, including interactions among environmental factors, ecological effects on the fitness consequences of plasticity, and various types of adaptive variance. Second, our framework for investigating variation in phenotypic variance reveals that interactions between levels of the hierarchy form the preconditions for the evolution of all types of plasticity, and we extend this idea to the residual level within individuals, where both adaptive plasticity in residuals and canalization-like processes (stability) can evolve. With the statistical tools now available to examine heterogeneous residual variance, an array of novel questions linking phenotype to environment can be usefully addressed.",present a heuristic statistical model to explore hierarchical variation in phenotypes within individuals,,,,statistical method,,all about phenotypes and within-individual variation,no,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

These social effects may play a major role in the evolution of cooperative breeding if social partners differ in the quality of care they provide and if individual carers adjust their effort in relation to that of other carers. When applying social effects models to wild study systems, it is also important to explore sources of individual plasticity that could masquerade as social effects. We studied offspring provisioning rates of parents and helpers in a wild population of long-tailed tits Aegithalos caudatus using a quantitative genetic framework to identify these social effects and partition them into genetic, permanent environment and current environment components. Controlling for other effects, individuals were consistent in their provisioning effort at a given nest, but adjusted their effort based on who was in their social group, indicating the presence of social effects. However, these social effects differed between years and social contexts, indicating a current environment effect, rather than indicating a genetic or permanent environment effect. While this study reveals the importance of examining environmental and genetic sources of social effects, the framework we present is entirely general, enabling a greater understanding of potentially important social effects within any ecological population.","individual plasticity can masquerade as social effects.

Although behavioural problems (e.g. anxiety, conduct, hyperactivity, peer problems) are known to be heritable both in early childhood and in adolescence, limited work has examined prediction across these ages, and none using a genetically informative sample.   Method. We examined, first, whether parental ratings of behavioural problems (indexed by the Strengths and Difficulties questionnaire) at ages 4, 7, 9, 12, and 16 years were stable across these ages. Second, we examined the extent to which stability reflected genetic or environmental effects through multivariate quantitative genetic analysis on data from a large (n > 3000) population (UK) sample of monozygotic and dizygotic twins.   Results. Behavioural problems in early childhood (age 4 years) showed significant associations with the corresponding behavioural problem at all subsequent ages. Moreover, stable genetic influences were observed across ages, indicating that biological bases underlying behavioural problems in adolescence are underpinned by genetic influences expressed as early as age 4 years. However, genetic and environmental innovations were also observed at each age.   Conclusion. These observations indicate that genetic factors are important for understanding stable individual differences in behavioural problems across childhood and adolescence, although novel genetic influences also facilitate change in such behaviours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Lifelong stability of behavioural syndromes is often assumed, either implicitly or explicitly. Here, we use a quantitative genetic approach to study the developmental stability of a behavioural syndrome in a wild population of blue tits. We find that a behavioural syndrome formed by a strong genetic correlation of two personality traits in nestlings disappears in adults, and we demonstrate that genotype age interaction is the likely mechanism underlying this change during development. A behavioural syndrome may hence change during organismal development, even when personality traits seem to be strongly physiologically or functionally linked in one age group. We outline how such developmental plasticity has important ramifications for understanding the mechanistic basis as well as the evolutionary consequences of behavioural syndromes.",behavioral syndrome in nestlings disappears in adults - genotype by age interaction is important,Cyanistes caeruleus,blue tits,Aves,quantitative genetic approach in the wild,pedigree,behavioral syndrome disappears with age,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

The genetic basis of SSB is almost wholly unknown in non-human animals, though this is key to understanding its persistence. Recent theoretical work has yielded broadly applicable predictions centred on two genetic models for SSB: over-dominance and sexual antagonism. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we assayed natural genetic variation for male SSB and empirically tested predictions about the mode of inheritance and fitness consequences of alleles influencing its expression. We screened 50 inbred lines derived from a wild population for male male courtship and copulation behaviour, and examined crosses between the lines for evidence of overdominance and antagonistic fecundity selection. Consistent variation among lines revealed heritable genetic variation for SSB, but the nature of the genetic variation was complex. Phenotypic and fitness variation was consistent with expectations under overdominance, although predictions of the sexual antagonism model were also supported. We found an unexpected and strong paternal effect on the expression of SSB, suggesting possible Y-linkage of the trait. Our results inform evolutionary genetic mechanisms that might maintain low but persistently observed levels of male SSB in D. melanogaster, but highlight a need for broader taxonomic representation in studies of its evolutionary causes.","consistent variation among lines revealed heritable genetic variation for same sex sexual behavior but the genetic variation was complex. found a strong paternal effect, suggesting Y linkage",Drosophila melanogaster,fruit fly,Insecta,assayed 50 inbred lines,inbred lines,cool example,maybe,x,x,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,not human

In contrast, few investigations have been made of the other necessary prerequisite for evolutionary change, inheritance. Here, we examine the fitness consequences and heritability (h(2)) of a post-weaning parental care behaviour (territory bequeathal) in a wild population of North American red squirrels. Each year, a subset (average across all years=19%) of reproductive females bequeathed their territory to a dependent offspring. Bequeathing females experienced higher annual reproductive success and did not suffer a survival cost to themselves relative to those females retaining their territory. Bequeathing females thus realized higher relative annual fitness [=1.18 +/- 0.03 (SE)] than nonbequeathing females [=0.96 +/- 0.02 (SE)]. Additive genetic influences on bequeathal behaviour, however, were not significantly different from 0 (h(2)=1.9x10(-3); 95% highest posterior density interval=3.04x10(-8) to 0.37) and, in fact, bequeathal behaviour was not significantly repeatable (R=2.0x10(-3); 95% HPD interval=0-0.27). In contrast, directional environmental influences were apparent. Females were more likely to bequeath in years following low food abundance and when food availability in the upcoming autumn was high. Despite an evident fitness benefit, a lack of heritable genetic variance will constrain evolution of this trait.","investigated behavior of reproductive females bequeathing their territory to a dependent offspring.

To study the genetic effects on individual-to-individual phenotypic variability (or intragenotypic variability), we used Drosophila inbred lines and measured the spontaneous locomotor behavior of flies walking individually in Y-shaped mazes, focusing on variability in locomotor handedness, an assay optimized to measure variability. We discovered that some lines had consistently high levels of intragenotypic variability among individuals, whereas lines with low variability behaved as although they tossed a coin at each left/right turn decision. We demonstrate that the degree of variability is itself heritable. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the degree of intragenotypic variability as the phenotype across lines, we identified several genes expressed in the brain that affect variability in handedness without affecting the mean. One of these genes, Ten-a, implicates a neuropil in the central complex of the fly brain as influencing the magnitude of behavioral variability, a brain region involved in sensory integration and locomotor coordination. We validated these results using genetic deficiencies, null alleles, and inducible RNAi transgenes. Our study reveals the constellation of phenotypes that can arise from a single genotype and shows that different genetic backgrounds differ dramatically in their propensity for phenotypic variabililty. Because traditional mean-focused GWASs ignore the contribution of variability to overall phenotypic variation, current methods may miss important links between genotype and phenotype.",heritable variability in locomotor behavior,Drosophila melanogaster,fruit fly,Insecta,used inbred lines,"inbred lines, GWAS",interesting example of heritability for variability among individuals,maybe,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,not human

Here, we applied the experimental evolution approach and compared BMR in lines of a wild rodent, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), selected for 11 generations for: high swim-induced aerobic metabolism (A), ability to maintain body mass on a low-quality herbivorous diet (H) and intensity of predatory behaviour towards crickets (P). Four replicate lines were maintained for each of the selection directions and an unselected control (C). In comparison to C lines, A lines achieved a 49% higher maximum rate of oxygen consumption during swimming, H lines lost 1.3 g less mass in the test with low-quality diet and P lines attacked crickets five times more frequently.

Although some populations and ecotypes will remain resident in freshwater habitats throughout their life history, others have the ability to undertake tremendous marine migrations. Those that migrate undergo a suite of behavioral, morphological, and physiological adaptations in a process called smoltification. We describe a quantitative genetic analysis of 22 growth, size, and morphological traits in addition to overall life history classification (resident or migrant) over the temporal process of smoltification in a large multi-generation experimental pedigree (n = 16,139) of migratory and resident rainbow trout derived from a wild population, which naturally segregates for migratory propensity. We identify significant additive genetic variance and covariance among the suite of traits that make up a component of the migratory syndrome in this species. Additionally, we identify high heritability estimates for the life history classifications and observe a strong negative genetic correlation between the migratory and resident life history trajectories. Given the large heritability estimates of all of the traits that segregate between migratory and resident rainbow trout, we conclude that these traits can respond to selection.

We sampled sticklebacks from 17 sites in north-western Europe in this first extensive study on the occurrence of carotenoid-based female pelvic spines and throat ornaments. The field results showed that females, and males, with reddish spines were found in all 17 populations. Specimens of both sexes with conspicuous red spines were found in several of the sites. The pelvic spines of males were more intensely red compared to the females' spines, and large specimens were more red than small ones. Fish infected with the tapeworm (Schistocephalus solidus) had drabber spines than uninfected fish. Both sexes had red spines both during and after the spawning period, but the intensity of the red colour was more exaggerated during the spawning period. As opposed to pelvic spines, no sign of red colour at the throat was observed in any female from any of the 17 populations. A rearing experiment was carried out to estimate a potential genetic component of the pelvic spine ornament by artificial crossing and rearing of 15 family groups during a 12 months period. The results indicated that the genetic component of the red colour at the spines was low or close to zero.

We aimed to evaluate the genetic variability of plant form and stature in a garden rose population, analyse the inheritance of plant architecture and its linkage with flowering behaviour and identify the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling garden rose architecture. A total of 98 F-1 hybrids were derived from the cross between two diploid roses, The Fairy (TF) and Rosa x wichurana (RW) that differed in stature and flowering behaviour. The TF exhibits continuous flowering (CF) and has erect stature. The RW is once flowering (OF) and prostrate in stature. Three clones per genotype were multiplied, and a total of 300 plants were cultivated in a field. Flowering behaviour, plant form, plant height, stem diameter and internode length were scored during each of 2 years. All architectural traits had significant genetic variances (29-61% of their respective phenotypic variances), and their broad-sense heritability estimates were 0.76-0.92. The majority of CF progeny was erect, whereas the OF progeny was prostrate, suggesting a linkage between plant form and flowering behaviour. The QTL analysis identified eight major QTLs controlling architectural traits. Several candidate genes involved in gibberellin biosynthesis and auxin signalling were identified in the vicinity of the QTLs. High heritability estimates obtained for garden rose architecture indicated that architectural characteristics are feasible targets of rose breeding.

Drosophila melanogaster, with its rich repertoire of courtship behavior and genomic and genetic resources, is an excellent model organism for addressing this question. We assayed a genetically diverse panel of lines with full genome sequences, the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, to assess the heritability of variation in courtship behavior and mating progression. We subsequently used these data to quantify natural variation in transition probabilities between courtship behaviors. We found heritable variation along the expected trajectory for courtship behaviors, including the tendency to initiate courtship and rate of progression through courtship, suggesting a genetic basis to male modulation of courtship behavior based on feedback from unrelated, outbred, and genetically identical females. We assessed the genetic basis of variation of the transition with the greatest heritability-from copulation to no engagement with the female-and identified variants in Serrate and Furin 1 as well as many other polymorphisms on the chromosome 3R associated with this transition.

However, the independent evolution of single traits cannot explain how observed phenotypic variations of these traits are maintained within populations. We studied genetic and phenotypic correlations between antipredator behaviors (shoaling and risk-taking) and morphology traits (pigmentation and size) in juvenile three-spined sticklebacks by using pedigree-based quantitative genetic analysis to test phenotypic integration (or complex phenotype) as an evolutionary response to predation risk. Individuals with strongly melanized (i.e., camouflaged) phenotype and genotype were less sociable to conspecifics, but bolder during foraging under predation risk. Individuals with faster growing phenotype and genotype were bolder, and those with lager eyes were more fearful. These phenotypic integrations were not confounded with correlated plastic responses to predation risk because the phenotypes were measured in naive fish born in the laboratory, but originated from a natural population with predation pressure.

However, although parental care in general is likely the result of adaptive evolution, it does not follow that specific differences in the maternal effects that arise from care are also adaptive. Here, we used an interspecific cross-fostering design in the burying beetle species Nicrophorus orbicollis and N.vespilloides, both of which have elaborate parental care involving direct feeding of regurgitated food to offspring, to test whether maternal effects are optimized within a species and therefore adaptive. Using a full-factorial design, we first demonstrated that N.orbicollis care for offspring longer regardless of recipient species. We then examined offspring development and mass in offspring reared by hetero- or conspecific parents. As expected, there were species-specific direct effects independent of the maternal effects, as N.orbicollis larvae were larger and took longer to develop than N.vespilloides regardless of caregiver. We also found significant differences in maternal effects: N.vespilloides maternal care caused more rapid development of offspring of either species. Contrary to expectations if maternal effects were species-specific, there were no significant interactions between caretaker and recipient species for either development time or mass, suggesting that these maternal effects are general rather than optimized within species. We suggest that rather than coadaptation between parents and offspring performance, the species differences in maternal effects may be correlated with direct effects, and that their evolution is driven by selection on those direct effects.",species differences in maternal effects are due to selection on direct effecs rather than coadaptation between parents and offspring performance.,Nicrophorus orbicollis and Nicrophorus vespilloides,burying beetle,Insecta,full-factorial design,full-factorial,significant differences in maternal effects. the species differences in maternal effects may be correlated with direct effects,no,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,m,,not human

It is one of the best predictors of important life outcomes such as education, occupation, mental and physical health and illness, and mortality. Intelligence is one of the most heritable behavioural traits. Here, we highlight five genetic findings that are special to intelligence differences and that have important implications for its genetic architecture and for gene-hunting expeditions. (i) The heritability of intelligence increases from about 20% in infancy to perhaps 80% in later adulthood. (ii) Intelligence captures genetic effects on diverse cognitive and learning abilities, which correlate phenotypically about 0.30 on average but correlate genetically about 0.60 or higher. (iii) Assortative mating is greater for intelligence (spouse correlations similar to 0.40) than for other behavioural traits such as personality and psychopathology (similar to 0.10) or physical traits such as height and weight (similar to 0.20). Assortative mating pumps additive genetic variance into the population every generation, contributing to the high narrow heritability (additive genetic variance) of intelligence. (iv) Unlike psychiatric disorders, intelligence is normally distributed with a positive end of exceptional performance that is a model for 'positive genetics'. (v) Intelligence is associated with education and social class and broadens the causal perspectives on how these three inter-correlated variables contribute to social mobility, and health, illness and mortality differences. These five findings arose primarily from twin studies. They are being confirmed by the first new quantitative genetic technique in a century-Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA)-which estimates genetic influence using genome-wide genotypes in large samples of unrelated individuals. Comparing GCTA results to the results of twin studies reveals important insights into the genetic architecture of intelligence that are relevant to attempts to narrow the 'missing heritability' gap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Evidence for such indirect (male) effect on reproduction is starting to accumulate. We quantify female and male effects on reproduction in the tawny owl Strix aluco using a hierarchical mixed model on data collected in 1978-2013. We find that differences between males explain 7 % of the phenotypic variance in laying date (females 5 %). In contrast, females have a clear (11 %) effect on clutch size, whereas males have no effect. Based on multivariate hierarchical modeling, we find an individual-level correlation between the male-specific effect on laying date and his body mass (but not his plumage color or wing length). Heavy males may be able to affect their partner's seasonal timing of laying because of an advantage in providing courtship feeding prior to reproduction. Our findings illustrate that males can be an important determinant of variation in reproduction and that multivariate mixed models present a general approach to pinpoint which individual characteristics could be associated with such indirect effects.","differences in males explain 7% of variance in laying date, wehreas females determine clutch size.

Personality differences can arise, for example, from differences in permanent environmental effects-including parental and epigenetic contributors- and the effect of additive genetic variation. Although several studies have evaluated the heritability of behaviour, less is known about general patterns of heritability and additive genetic variation in animal personality. As overall variation in behaviour includes both the among-individual differences that reflect different personalities and temporary environmental effects, it is possible for personality to be largely genetically influenced even when heritability of behaviour per se is quite low. The relative contribution of additive genetic variation to personality variation can be estimated whenever both repeatability and heritability are estimated for the same data. Using published estimates to address this issue, we found that approximately 52% of animal personality variation was attributable to additive genetic variation. Thus, while the heritability of behaviour is often moderate or low, the heritability of personality is much higher. Our results therefore (i) demonstrate that genetic differences are likely to be a major contributor to variation in animal personality and (ii) support the phenotypic gambit: that evolutionary inferences drawn from repeatability estimates may often be justified.",less is known about the general patterns of heritability and additive genetic variation in animal behavior.

 S, YEAR IN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY," Duckworth, RAAF Duckworth, Renee A.", Neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying behavioral stability: implications   for the evolutionary origin of personality,1360,2015," Personality traits are behaviors that show limited flexibility over time and across contexts, and thus understanding their origin requires an understanding of what limits behavioral flexibility. Here, I suggest that insight into the evolutionary origin of personality traits requires determining the relative importance of selection and constraint in producing limits to behavioral flexibility. Natural selection as the primary cause of limits to behavioral flexibility assumes that the default state of behavior is one of high flexibility and predicts that personality variation arises through evolution of buffering mechanisms to stabilize behavioral expression, whereas the constraint hypothesis assumes that the default state is one of limited flexibility and predicts that the neuroendocrine components that underlie personality variation are those most constrained in flexibility. Using recent work on the neurobiology of sensitive periods and maternal programming of offspring behavior, I show that some of the most stable aspects of the neuroendocrine system are structural components and maternally induced epigenetic effects. Evidence of numerous constraints to changes in structural features of the neuroendocrine system and far fewer constraints to flexibility of epigenetic systems suggests that structural constraints play a primary role in the origin of behavioral stability and that epigenetic programming may be more important in generating adaptive variation among individuals.",need to know relative importance of selection and constraint in producign limits to behavioral flexibility. some of the most stable aspects of the neuroendocrine system are structural components and maternally induced epigenetic effects.

Mechanisms behind the association were tested in children-of-siblings models across three types of sibling fathers with increasing genetic relatedness (half-siblings, full siblings, and monozygotic twins) and in quantitative genetic models. Sons whose fathers had a criminal conviction had lower cognitive ability than sons whose fathers had no conviction (any crime: Cohen's d = -0.28; violent crime: Cohen's d = -0.49). As models adjusted for more genetic factors, the association was gradually reduced and eventually eliminated. Nuclear-family environmental factors did not contribute to the association.

Inter-individual differences in mating preferences have been studied for some time, but most studies focus on the location of the peak preference rather than on other aspects of preference functions. In this review, we discuss the role of variation in choosiness in inter-sexual selection. We define individual-level choosiness as the change in mating propensity in response to different stimulus signals. We illustrate general issues in estimating aspects of preference functions and discuss experimental setups for quantifying variation in choosiness with a focus on choices based on acoustic signals in insects. One important consideration is whether preferences are measured sequentially one stimulus at a time or in competitive multiple-choice setups; the suitability of these alternatives depends on the ecology of the study species. Furthermore, we discuss the usefulness of behavioural proxies for determining preference functions, which can be misleading if the proxies are not linearly related to mating propensity. Finally, we address statistical approaches, including the use of function-valued trait analysis, for studying choosiness. Most of the conclusions can be generalized beyond acoustic signals in insects and to choices in non-sexual contexts.",not relevant,,,,review,,discuss the role of variation in choosiness in intersexual selection and illustrate issues in measuring preferences and preference functions,no,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Quantitative genetic theory and empirical approaches have been developed over the past 60 years specifically to study the genetic implications of social interactions. Surprisingly, given the obvious biological importance of social interactions in social insects, this research tradition has been and continues to be widely overlooked throughout the social insect literature, including in recent sociogenomic studies focused on understanding the molecular underpinnings of social life. Instead, the overwhelming majority of social insect genetic research has relied on conventional genetic approaches developed for solitary organisms focused on the one-to-one association of an individual's genes to its own traits. I survey social insect studies that conclusively demonstrate the importance of indirect genetic effects (IGEs), which arise from social interactions, for social insect trait expression and evolution. I explain why these genetically based social effects are expected to be ubiquitous in social insects and I explain the relevance of the IGE framework, originally developed within quantitative genetics, for molecular genetic studies of social insect traits such as behaviour and caste. I discuss the problems of ignoring IGEs and relying solely on conventional direct genetic effect approaches. Finally, I discuss the strong potential of using the IGE approach and other more systems-level-focused approaches to complement conventional reductionist approaches in elucidating the genetic basis of social insect trait expression and evolution.","importance of IGEs for social insect trait expression, and discuss IGEs within the quantitative genetics framework",Hymenoptera,social insects,Insecta,review,,IGEs are important to social insects,probably not,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,x,,not human
 S, EPISTASIS: METHODS AND PROTOCOLS," Mackay, TFCAF Mackay, Trudy F. C.", Epistasis for Quantitative Traits in Drosophila,1253,2015," The role of gene-gene interactions in the genetic architecture of quantitative traits is controversial, despite the biological plausibility of nonlinear molecular interactions underpinning variation in quantitative traits. In strictly outbreeding populations, genetic architecture is inferred indirectly by estimating variance components; however, failure to detect epistatic variance does not mean lack of epistatic gene action and is even consistent with pervasive epistasis. In Drosophila, more focused approaches to detecting epistatic gene action are possible, based on the ability to create de novo mutations and perform crosses among them; to construct inbred lines, artificial selection lines, and chromosome substitution lines; to map quantitative trait loci affecting complex traits by linkage and association; and to evaluate effects of induced mutations on multiple wild-derived backgrounds. Here, I review evidence for epistasis in Drosophila from the application of these methods, and conclude that additivity is an emergent property of underlying epistatic gene action for Drosophila quantitative traits. Such studies can be used to infer novel, highly interconnected genetic networks that are enriched for gene ontology categories and metabolic and cellular pathways. The consequence of epistasis is that the main effects of each of the interacting loci depend on allele frequency, which negatively impacts the predictive ability of additive models. Finally, epistasis results in hidden quantitative genetic variation in natural populations (genetic canalization) and the potential for rapid evolution of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (speciation).",review evidence for epsitasis and conclude that additivity is an emrgent property of underlying epistatic gene action for Drosophila. ,Drosophila melanogaster,fruit fly,Insecta,review,,"cool evidence for epistatic effects being important, but not relevant",no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

The biological rhythms of mosquitoes regulate many of the physiological processes and behaviors that influence the transmission of these diseases. For insight into the molecular basis of biological rhythms, diel and circadian gene expression profiling has been carried out for many species. To bring these resources to Aedes aegypti researchers, we used microarray technology to carry out a genome wide assessment of gene expression during the 24 hour light/dark (LD) cycle and during constant darkness (DD). The purpose of this report is to describe the methods, the validation of the results, and the organization of this database resource.   Description: The Aedes aegypti Circadian Database is a publicly accessible database that can be searched via a text-based query to visualize 44 hour temporal expression patterns of a given gene in Ae. aegypti heads under diel (observed under a 12 hour/12 hour LD cycle) and circadian (observed under DD) conditions. Profiles of gene expression under these conditions were assayed by Nimblegen 12-plex microarrays and rhythmicity was objectively assessed by the JTK_CYCLE algorithm. The output of the search is a graphical representation of the expression data along with computed period length, the time-of-day of gene expression peaks, and statistical determination for rhythmicity.   Conclusion: Our results show that at least 7.9% of the gene set present in the Aedes aegypti head are rhythmic under LD conditions and 6.7% can be considered circadian, oscillating under constant dark conditions. We present these results in the Aedes aegypti Circadian Database through Bioclock, a public website hosted by the University of Notre Dame at http://www.nd.edu/similar to bioclock/.

However, the genetic architecture of these phenotypes can influence their evolvability and thereby affect the divergence of species. The extraordinary diversity of East African cichlid fishes is often attributed to strong sexual selection and thus this system provides an excellent model to test predictions regarding the genetic architecture of sexually selected traits that contribute to reproductive isolation. In particular, theory predicts that rapid speciation is facilitated when male sexual traits and female mating preferences are controlled by a limited number of linked genes. However, few studies have examined the genetic basis of male secondary sexual traits and female mating preferences in cichlids and none have investigated the genetic architecture of both jointly. In this study, we artificially hybridized a pair of behaviorally isolated cichlid fishes from Lake Malawi and quantified both melanistic color pattern and female mate choice. We investigated the genetic architecture of both phenotypes using quantitative genetic analyses. Our results suggest that 1) many non-additively acting genetic factors influence melanistic color patterns, 2) female mate choice may be controlled by a minimum of 1-2 non-additive genetic factors, and 3) F-2 female mate choice is not influenced by male courting effort. Furthermore, a joint analysis of color pattern and female mate choice indicates that the genes underlying these two traits are unlikely to be physically linked. These results suggest that reproductive isolation may evolve rapidly owing to the few genetic factors underlying female mate choice.

Owing to their direct effect on traits such as metabolic and growth rates, mitonuclear interactions may also affect variation in behavioural types or personalities (i.e. behavioural variation that is consistent within individuals, but differs among individuals). However, this possibility is largely unexplored. We used mitonuclear introgression lines, where three mitochondrial genomes were introgressed into three nuclear genetic backgrounds, to disentangle genetic effects on behavioural variation in a seed beetle. We found within-individual consistency in a suite of activity-related behaviours, providing evidence for variation in personality. Composite measures of overall activity of individuals in behavioural assays were influenced by both nuclear genetic variation and by the interaction between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. More importantly, the degree of expression of behavioural and life-history phenotypes was correlated and mitonuclear genetic variation affected expression of these concerted phenotypes.

Because intermediate-shaped beetles are less proficient in these two behaviours, stout-slender morphological divergence occurs between related species feeding on land snails. To examine the genetic basis of these morphotypes, we conducted morphological analyses and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping using backcross offspring between the stout and slender subspecies. The morphological analyses showed that the width and length of the beetle body parts were correlated with each other; in particular, the head width (HW) and thorax length (TL) were strongly negatively correlated. QTL mapping showed that QTLs for HW and TL are located in close proximity to one another on the longest linkage group and that they have positive and negative additive genetic effects.

While some individuals possess the ability to undertake an anadromous marine migration, others remain resident in freshwater throughout their life cycle. Those that will migrate undergo tremendous physiological, morphological, and behavioral transformations in a process called smoltification which transitions freshwater-adapted parr to marine-adapted smolts. While the behavior, ecology, and physiology of smoltification are well described, our understanding of the proximate genetic mechanisms that trigger the process are not well known. Quantitative genetic analyses have identified several genomic regions associated with smoltification and migration-related traits within this species. Here we investigate the divergence in gene expression of 18 functional and positional candidate genes for the smoltification process in the brain, gill, and liver tissues of migratory smolts, resident parr, and precocious mature male trout at the developmental stage of out-migration.

 J, BEHAVIOR GENETICS," Plomin, RAF Plomin, Robert", Genotype-Environment Correlation in the Era of DNA,44,2014," One of John Loehlin's many contributions to the field of behavioral genetics involves gene-environment (GE) correlation. The empirical base for GE correlation was research showing that environmental measures are nearly as heritable as behavioral measures and that genetic factors mediate correlations between environment and behavior. Attempts to identify genes responsible for these phenomena will come up against the 'missing heritability' problem that plagues DNA research on complex traits throughout the life sciences. However, DNA can also be used for quantitative genetic analyses of unrelated individuals (Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis, GCTA) to investigate genetic influence on environmental measures and their behavioral correlates. A novel feature of GCTA is that it enables genetic analysis of family-level environments (e. g., parental socioeconomic status) and schoollevel environments (e. g., teaching quality) that cannot be investigated using within-family designs such as the twin method. An important implication of GE correlation is its shift from a passive model of the environment imposed on individuals to an active model in which individuals actively create their own experiences in part on the basis of their genetic propensities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Genetic correlations between components of such combinatorial traits, in the form of pleiotropic or tightly linked genes, can in principle promote the evolution and maintenance of these traits. In the Oriental Drosophila melanogaster species group, male wing pigmentation shows phylogenetic correlations with male courtship behavior; species with male-specific apical wing melanin spots also exhibit male visual wing displays, whereas species lacking these spots generally lack the displays. In this study, we investigated the quantitative genetic basis of divergence in male wing spots and displays between D. elegans, which possesses both traits, and its sibling species D. gunungcola, which lacks them. We found that divergence in wing spot size is determined by at least three quantitative trait loci (QTL) and divergence in courtship score is determined by at least four QTL. On the autosomes, QTL locations for pigmentation and behavior were generally separate, but on the X chromosome two clusters of QTL were found affecting both wing pigmentation and courtship behavior. We also examined the genetic basis of divergence in three components of male courtship, wing display, circling, and body shaking. Each of these showed a distinct genetic architecture, with some QTL mapping to similar positions as QTL for overall courtship score. Pairwise tests for interactions between marker loci revealed evidence of epistasis between putative QTL for wing pigmentation but not those for courtship behavior. The clustering of X-linked QTL for male pigmentation and behavior is consistent with the concerted evolution of these traits and motivates fine-scale mapping studies to elucidate the nature of the contributing genetic factors in these intervals.","correlations between male wing patterns, which are correlated with courtship traits.

A."," The quantitative genetics of sexually selected traits, preferred traits   and preference: a review and analysis of the data",27,2014," The maintenance of variation in sexually selected traits is a puzzle that has received increasing attention in the past several decades. Traits that are related to fitness, such as life-history or sexually selected traits, are expected to have low additive genetic variance (and hence, heritability) due to the rapid fixation of advantageous alleles. However, previous analyses have suggested that the heritabilities of sexually selected traits are on average higher than nonsexually selected traits. We show that the heritabilities of sexually selected traits are not significantly different from those of nonsexually selected traits overall or when separated into the three trait categories: behavioural, morphological and physiological. In contrast with previous findings, the heritability of preference is quite low (h(2) = 0.25 +/- 0.06) and is in the same range as life-history traits. We distinguish preferred traits as a category of sexually selected traits and find that the heritability of the former is not significantly different than sexually selected traits overall (0.48 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.46 +/- 0.03). We test the hypothesis that the heritability of sexually selected traits is negatively correlated with the strength of sexual selection. As predicted, there is a significant negative correlation between the heritabilities of sexually selected traits and the strength of selection. This suggests that heritabilities do indeed decrease as sexual selection increases but sexual selection is not strong enough to cause heritabilities of sexually selected traits to deviate from the same type of nonsexually selected traits.",evaluates heritabilites of behavioral traits in contrast to morphological and physiological traits,,,,"review existing data, lumping traits into three categories",,useful to get a quick overview,yes,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

This ""questing'' behaviour is known to be temperature-dependent, such that questing increases with temperature up to a point where the vapor pressure deficit (drying effect) forces ticks down to rehydrate in the soil or mat layer. Little if any attention has been paid to understanding the questing of ticks from an evolutionary perspective. Here we ask whether populations from colder climatic conditions respond differently in terms of the threshold temperature for questing and the rate of response to a fixed temperature. We find significant variation between populations in the temperature sensitivity of questing, with populations from cooler climates starting questing at lower temperatures than populations from warmer temperatures. Cool climate populations also quest sooner when the temperature is held constant. These patterns are consistent with local adaptation to temperature either through direct selection or acclimation and challenge the use of fixed thresholds for questing in modeling the spread of tick populations. Our results also show how both time and temperature play a role in questing, but we are unable to explain the relationship in terms of degree-time used to model Arthropod development. We find that questing in response to temperature fits well with a quantitative genetic model of the conditional strategy, which reveals how selection on questing may operate and hence may be of value in understanding the evolutionary ecology of questing.","not really quantitative genetics

As predation risk is often higher during juvenile stages, antipredator defences expressed early in life are paramount to survival. Maternal effects are an efficient pathway to produce such defences. We investigated whether maternal exposure to predator cues during gestation affected juvenile morphology, behaviour and dispersal in common lizards (Zootoca vivipara). We exposed 21 gravid females to saurophagous snake cues for one month while 21 females remained unexposed (i.e. control). We measured body size, preferred temperature and activity level for each neonate, and released them into semi-natural enclosures connected to corridors in order to measure dispersal. Offspring from exposed mothers grew longer tails, selected lower temperatures and dispersed thrice more than offspring from unexposed mothers. Because both tail autotomy and altered thermoregulatory behaviour are common antipredator tactics in lizards, these results suggest that mothers adjusted offspring phenotype to risky natal environments (tail length) or increased risk avoidance (dispersal). Although maternal effects can be passive consequences of maternal stress, our results strongly militate for them to be an adaptive antipredator response that may increase offspring survival prospects.","did maternal exposure to predator cues during gestation impact juvenile morphology, behavior and dispersal?

Coude, Gino   Grigaityte, Kristina   Iacoboni, Marco   Ferrari, Pier Francesco", Empathy: Gender effects in brain and behavior,46,2014," Evidence suggests that there are differences in the capacity for empathy between males and females. However, how deep do these differences go? Stereotypically, females are portrayed as more nurturing and empathetic, while males are portrayed as less emotional and more cognitive. Some authors suggest that observed gender differences might be largely due to cultural expectations about gender roles. However, empathy has both evolutionary and developmental precursors, and can be studied using implicit measures, aspects that can help elucidate the respective roles of culture and biology. This article reviews evidence from ethology, social psychology, economics, and neuroscience to show that there are fundamental differences in implicit measures of empathy, with parallels in development and evolution. Studies in nonhuman animals and younger human populations (infants/children) offer converging evidence that sex differences in empathy have phylogenetic and ontogenetic roots in biology and are not merely cultural byproducts driven by socialization. We review how these differences may have arisen in response to males' and females' different roles throughout evolution. Examinations of the neurobiological underpinnings of empathy reveal important quantitative gender differences in the basic networks involved in affective and cognitive forms of empathy, as well as a qualitative divergence between the sexes in how emotional information is integrated to support decision making processes. Finally, the study of gender differences in empathy can be improved by designing studies with greater statistical power and considering variables implicit in gender (e.g., sexual preference, prenatal hormone exposure). These improvements may also help uncover the nature of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in which one sex is more vulnerable to compromised social competence associated with impaired empathy.

Lack of variation in the underlying morphology of signalling traits has the potential to constrain signal evolution. This relationship is particularly likely in field crickets, where males produce acoustic advertisement signals to attract females by stridulating with specialized structures on their forewings. In this study, we characterize the size and geometric shape of the forewings of males from six allopatric populations of the black field cricket (Teleogryllus commodus) known to have divergent advertisement calls. We sample from each of these populations using both wild-caught and common-garden-reared cohorts, allowing us to test for multivariate relationships between wing morphology and call structure. We show that the allometry of shape has diverged across populations. However, there was a surprisingly small amount of covariation between wing shape and call structure within populations. Given the importance of male size for sexual selection in crickets, the divergence we observe among populations has the potential to influence the evolution of advertisement calls in this species.","small amount of covariation between wing shape and call structure within populations, but found divergence among populations",Teleogryllus commodus,black field cricket,Insecta,wild caught and common garden reared cohort,common-garden,not precisely behavior but an example of signals diverging,probably not,,x,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

SDP was associated with all outcomes. Within-family analyses of the pregnancy outcomes were consistent with a causal interpretation as the associations persisted when siblings discordant for SDP were compared. For the cognitive and externalizing outcomes, the results were not consistent with causal effects; when comparing differentially exposed siblings none of the associations remained significant. In quantitative genetic models genetic factors explained the majority of the associations between SDP and cognitive and externalizing outcomes.

Phenotypic integration plasticity refers to the change in patterns of phenotypic integration across environments or ontogeny. Because studies of phenotypic plasticity have predominantly focussed on single traits, a GxE interaction is typically perceived as differences in the magnitude of trait expression across two or more environments. However, many plastic responses involve coordinated responses in multiple traits, raising the possibility that relative differences in trait expression in different environments are an important, but often overlooked, source of GxE interaction. Here, we use phenotypic change vectors to statistically compare the multivariate life-history plasticity of six Daphnia magna clones collected from four disparate European populations.

Muscle structure and function are one of many morphological and physiological systems acting to simultaneously determine exercise ability. We generated a large (n = 815) advanced intercross line of mice (G(4)) derived from a line selectively bred for increased wheel running (high runner) and the C57BL/6J inbred strain. We previously mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) contributing to voluntary exercise, body composition, and changes in body composition as a result of exercise. Using brain tissue in a subset of the G(4) (n = 244), we have also previously reported expression QTL (eQTL) colocalizing with the QTL for the higher-level phenotypes. Here, we examined the transcriptional landscape of hind limb muscle tissue via global mRNA expression profiles. Correlations revealed an similar to 1,168% increase in significant relationships between muscle transcript expression levels and the same exercise and body composition phenotypes examined previously in the brain. The exercise trait most often significantly correlated with gene expression in the brain was running duration while in the muscle it was maximum running speed. This difference may indicate that time spent engaging in exercise behavior may be more influenced by central (neurobiological) mechanisms, while intensity of exercise may be largely controlled by peripheral mechanisms. Additionally, we used subsets of cis-acting eQTL, colocalizing with QTL, to identify candidate genes based on both positional and functional evidence.

The dramatic environmental changes shape their physiological features, e. g. visual sensitivity, olfactory ability, and salinity tolerance. Anguilla marmorata, a catadromous eel, migrates upstream on dark nights, following the lunar cycle. Such behavior may be correlated with ontogenetic changes in sensory systems. Therefore, this study was designed to identify changes in spectral sensitivity and opsin gene expression of A. marmorata during upstream migration. Microspectrophotometry analysis revealed that the tropical eel possesses a duplex retina with rod and cone photoreceptors. The lambda(max) of rod cells are 493, 489, and 489 nm in glass, yellow, and wild eels, while those of cone cells are 508, and 517 nm in yellow, and wild eels, respectively. Unlike European and American eels, Asian eels exhibited a blue-shifted pattern of rod photoreceptors during upstream migration. Quantitative gene expression analyses of four cloned opsin genes (Rh1f, Rh1d, Rh2, and SWS2) revealed that Rh1f expression is dominant at all three stages, while Rh1d is expressed only in older yellow eel. Furthermore, sequence comparison and protein modeling studies implied that a blue shift in Rh1d opsin may be induced by two known (N83, S292) and four putative (S124, V189, V286, I290) tuning sites adjacent to the retinal binding sites. Finally, expression of blue-shifted Rh1d opsin resulted in a spectral shift in rod photoreceptors.

Palmer, Abraham A.", Fine-mapping QTLs in advanced intercross lines and other outbred   populations,25,2014," Quantitative genetic studies in model organisms, particularly in mice, have been extremely successful in identifying chromosomal regions that are associated with a wide variety of behavioral and other traits. However, it is now widely understood that identification of the underlying genes will be far more challenging. In the last few years, a variety of populations have been utilized in an effort to more finely map these chromosomal regions with the goal of identifying specific genes. The common property of these newer populations is that linkage disequilibrium spans relatively short distances, which permits fine-scale mapping resolution. This review focuses on advanced intercross lines (AILs) which are the simplest such population. As originally proposed in 1995 by Darvasi and Soller, an AIL is the product of intercrossing two inbred strains beyond the F-2 generation. Unlike recombinant inbred strains, AILs are maintained as outbred populations; brother-sister matings are specifically avoided. Each generation of intercrossing beyond the F-2 further degrades linkage disequilibrium between adjacent makers, which allows for fine-scale mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Advances in genotyping technology and techniques for the statistical analysis of AILs have permitted rapid advances in the application of AILs. We review some of the analytical issues and available software, including QTLRel, EMMA, EMMAX, GEMMA, TASSEL, GRAMMAR, WOMBAT, Mendel, and others.","review fine mapping using advanced intercross lines, which allow for fine-scale mapping of QTLS.",,,,review,,worth skimming to get an overview of this method,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

It has now become increasingly clear that IQ is heritable in humans, but these effects can be modified by nongenetic mechanisms [2-4]. In contrast to human IQ, until recently, views of learning and cognition in animals have largely been dominated by the behaviorist school of thought, originally championed by Watson [5] and Skinner [6]. A large body of accumulated research now demonstrates a variety of cognitive abilities in nonhuman animals and challenges traditional behaviorist interpretations of performance [7, 8]. This, in turn, has led to a renewed interest in the role that social and biological factors might play in explaining individual and phylogenetic differences in cognition [9]. Specifically, aside from early attempts to selectively breed for learning skills in rodents [10-12], studies examining the role that genetic factors might play in individual variation in cognitive abilities in nonhuman animals, particularly nonhuman primates, are scarce. Here, we utilized a modified Primate Cognitive Test Battery [13] in conjunction with quantitative genetic analyses to examine whether cognitive performance is heritable in chimpanzees. We found that some but not all cognitive traits were significantly heritable in chimpanzees. We further found significant genetic correlations between different dimensions of cognitive functioning, suggesting that the genes that explain the variability of one cognitive trait might also explain that of other cognitive traits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

The simulations show that the equilibrium heritabilities of the preference and preferred trait and the genetic correlation between them (r(G)), depend critically on aspects of the mating system (the preference function, mode of mate choice, choosiness, and number of potential mates sampled), the presence or absence of natural selection on the preferred trait, and the initial genetic parameters. Under some parameter combinations, preferential mating increased the heritability of the preferred trait, providing a possible resolution for the lek paradox. The Kirkpatrick-Barton approximation for rG proved to be biased downward, but the realized genetic correlations were also low, generally <0.2. Such low values of r(G) indicate that coevolution of the preference and preferred trait is likely to be very slow and subject to significant stochastic variation. Lande's model accurately predicted the incidence of runaway selection in the simulations, except where preferences were relative and the preferred trait was subject to natural selection. In these cases, runaways were over-or underestimated, depending on the number of males sampled. We conclude that rapid coevolution of preferences and preferred traits is unlikely in natural populations, but that the parameter combinations most conducive to it are most likely to occur in lekking species.",theoretical and simulation model of preference and preferred traits - find that preferential mating can increase heritability of the preferred trait,,,,model,,more realistic extension of Land'es model,yes,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Despite having received much attention, the causes and consequences of this variation remain obscure. Theoretically, such within-population variation in fitness-related traits can be maintained by environmental heterogeneity in selection patterns, but for MR, this has rarely been tested in nature. Here, we experimentally test whether the relationship between MR and performance can vary spatially by assessing survival, growth rate and movement of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) juveniles from 10 family groups differing in MR (measured as egg metabolism) that were stocked in parallel across 10 tributaries of a single watershed. The relationship between MR and relative survival and growth rate varied significantly among tributaries. Specifically, the effect of MR ranged from negative to positive for relative survival, whereas it was negative for growth rate. The association between MR and movement was positive and did not vary significantly among tributaries.

Method: Phenotypic and quantitative genetic analyses using longitudinal data from the Twins Early Development Study (Oliver & Plomin, 2007) were conducted. A total of 2,923 pairs of twins (1,075 monozygotic [MZ]; 975 dizygotic same sex [DZss]; and 873 dizygotic opposite sex [DZos]) provided data at 4 and 12 years. At 4 years, (a) psychometric LI was defined on the basis of a low parent-reported expressive vocabulary score (-1.25 SDs; 226 MZand 115 DZss probands for genetic analysis); and (b) parent referral was defined as having seen a medical professional or speech-language pathologist following parental concern (112 MZ and 104 DZss probands). The 12-year language measure was a composite of 4 web-administered receptive language tests.   Results: (a) Psychometric LI at 4 years is more predictive than parent referral of poor language performance at age 12 years, and (b) parent referral is substantially and significantly more heritable than psychometric LI.   Conclusions: Parents' concern about their child's language development seems to be the marker of a more heritable disorder than poor expressive language skills alone. However, the language difficulties that arouse parental concern in preschool children, although more heritable, are not predictive of language difficulties in early adolescence. Rather, poor expressive language skills at age 4 years, psychometrically defined, are a better predictor than parent referral of continuing language difficulties at age 12 years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Existing assays of LUT function in animal models are often invasive; however, a noninvasive assay is required to study symptom progression and determine genetic correlates. Here, we present a spontaneous voiding assay that is simple, reproducible, quantitative, and noninvasive. Young female mice from eight inbred mouse strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/H1LtJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) were tested for urination patterns on filter paper. Repeat testing at different times of the day showed minimal within-individual and within-strain variations, but all parameters (spot number, total volume, percent area in primary void, corner voiding, and center voiding) exhibited significant variations between strains. Calculation of the intraclass correlation coefficient, an estimate of broad-sense heritability, for each time of day and for each voiding parameter revealed highly significant heritability [spot number: 61%, percent urine in primary void: 90%, and total volume: 94% (afternoon data)]. Cystometrograms confirmed strong strain-specific urodynamic characteristics. Behavior-voiding correlation analysis showed no correlation with anxiety phenotypes. Diagnostically, the assay revealed LUT symptoms in several systems, including a demonstration of voiding abnormalities in older C57BL/6J mice (18-24 mo), in a model of protamine sulfate-induced urothelial damage and in a model of sucrose-induced diuresis. This assay may be used to derive pathophysiological LUT readouts from mouse models.

To estimate the evolvability and adaptability of individually consistent behavioral variation, there is a crucial need to quantify the genetics underlying personality. Here, we experimentally studied the repeatability of various individual behaviors and then estimated heritability of formed boldness, exploration, and aggression components in juvenile brown trout Salmo trutta in standardized laboratory environment. Principal component analysis indicated that individually recorded behaviors were described by two personality axes: the first reflecting boldness, exploration, and aggression and the second tendency to freeze. These personality components, as well as the originally recorded behaviors, were statistically significantly repeatable over time. The latter PC, but not the first one, was statistically significantly heritable, though at low level (h (2) = 0.142 +/- 0.096). These results suggest that additive genetic variation underlies phenotypically consistent behavioral patterns, proposing that any selection acting on behavior, stress tolerance, or correlated traits has a potential to induce evolution in fish personality.","estimated heritability and repeatability of boldness, exploration and aggression.

While ecological and quantitative genetic studies have evaluated models of the evolution of adaptive plasticity, some long-standing questions about plasticity require more mechanistic approaches. Here, we address two of those questions: does plasticity facilitate adaptive evolution? And do physiological costs place limits on plasticity? We examine these questions by comparing genetically and plastically regulated behavioural variation in sailfin mollies (Poecilia latipinna), which exhibit striking variation in plasticity for male mating behaviour. In this species, some genotypes respond plastically to a change in the social environment by switching between primarily courting and primarily sneaking behaviour. In contrast, other genotypes have fixed mating strategies (either courting or sneaking) and do not display plasticity. We found that genetic and plastic variation in behaviour were accompanied by partially, but not completely overlapping changes in brain gene expression, in partial support of models that predict that plasticity can facilitate adaptive evolution. We also found that behavioural plasticity was accompanied by broader and more robust changes in brain gene expression, suggesting a substantial physiological cost to plasticity. We also observed that sneaking behaviour, but not courting, was associated with upregulation of genes involved in learning and memory, suggesting that sneaking is more cognitively demanding than courtship.","does plasticity facilitate adaptive evolution and do physiological costs place limits on plasticity?

In this study, we applied quantitative genetic barcoding to track the clonal output of transplanted autologous rhesus macaque hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells over a time period of up to 9.5 months. We found that unilineage short-term progenitors reconstituted myeloid and lymphoid lineages at 1 month but were supplanted over time by multilineage clones, initially myeloid restricted, then myeloid-B clones, and then stable myeloid-B-T multilineage, long-term repopulating clones. Surprisingly, reconstitution of the natural killer (NK) cell lineage, and particularly the major CD16(+)/CD56(-) peripheral blood NK compartment, showed limited clonal overlap with T, B, or myeloid lineages, and therefore appears to be ontologically distinct.

To this end, three studies utilize a quantitative genetic approach, whereas two others use molecular genetic methodologies. Covering a wide age range from early childhood to early adulthood, the studies examine different processes of gene-environment correlation and gene-environment interaction while focusing on dyadic and group-based peer experiences (e. g., friendships, peer acceptance, and peer victimization) as well as on positive and negative aspects of social development (e. g., prosocial leadership and aggression).

Employing a quantitative genetic framework, the results of the current study revealed that variance in language skills, negative peer interactions, and externalizing behavioral problems were all due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Bivariate Cholesky models indicated that most of the covariance among language skills, negative peer interactions, and externalizing behavioral problems was due to common genetic factors. Additional analyses using a modified DeFries-Fulker approach nested within a path model revealed a bidirectional association between negative peer interactions and externalizing behavioral problems, wherein there appeared to be feedback loops between the two.

The current study addresses this gap in the literature by examining the nexus between biosocial criminology and the social support perspective as it relates to levels of self-control. To do so, a sample of twin pairs from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) was analyzed using quantitative genetic analyses. The analyses revealed three key findings. First, genetic factors account for about 50% of the variance in measures of social support. Second, the covariance between social support and self-control is largely due to a common genetic pathway.

We capitalized on a long-term study of wild yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) to study the importance of maternal effects on explaining variation in anogenital distance and found significant effects. The strength of these effects varied annually. Taken together, our data highlights the strong variability due to environmental effects, and illustrates the importance of additive genetic and maternal genetic effects on neonatal anogenital distance.

The neurobiology underlying these phenotypes is unclear, although there is evidence for serotonergic abnormalities in the striatum and hippocampus.   Methods: Using microarray and quantitative gene expression analyses, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we compared brain gene expression and steroid biochemistry in wildtype (40, XY) and 39, XY* O adult mice to identify non-obvious genetic and endocrine candidates for between-group differences in behaviour and neurochemistry. We also tested whether acute STS inhibition by COUMATE in wildtype (40, XY) adult male mice recapitulated any significant gene expression or biochemical findings from the genetic comparison. Data were analysed by unpaired t-test or Mann Whitney U-test depending on normality, with a single factor of KARYOTYPE.   Results: Microarray analysis indicated seven robust gene expression differences between the two groups (Vmn2r86, Sfil, Pisd-ps1, Tagap1, C1qc, Metap1d, Erdr1); Erdr1 and C1qc expression was significantly reduced in the 39, XY* O striatum and hippocampus, whilst the expression of Dhcr7 (encoding 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, a modulator of serotonin system development), was only reduced in the 39, X-Y* O hippocampus. None of the confirmed gene expression changes could be recapitulated by COUMATE administration. We detected ten free, and two sulphated steroids in 40, XY and 39, XY* O brain; surprisingly, the concentrations of all of these were equivalent between groups.   Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that the mutation in 39, X-Y* O mice: i) directly disrupts expression of the adjacent Erdr1 gene, ii) induces a remarkably limited suite of downstream gene expression changes developmentally, with several of relevance to associated neurobehavioural phenotypes and iii) does not elicit large changes in brain steroid biochemistry. It is possible that individuals with STS/ASMT deficiency exhibit a similarly specific pattern of gene expression changes to the 39, X-Y* O mouse, and that these contribute towards their abnormal neurobiology.

The existence of such consistency contrasts to the expectation based on classical behavioral theory that facultative behavior maximizes individual fitness. Here, we study two personality traits (aggression and breath rate during handling) in a wild population of blue tits during 2007–2012. Handling aggression and breath rate were moderately heritable (h2 = 0.35 and 0.20, respectively) and not genetically correlated (rA = 0.06) in adult blue tits, which permits them to evolve independently. Reciprocal cross‐fostering (2007–2010) showed that offspring reared by more aggressive males have a higher probability to recruit. In addition, offspring reared by pairs mated assortatively for handling aggression had a higher recruitment probability, which is the first evidence that both parents' personalities influence their reproductive success in the wild in a manner independent of their genetic effects. Handling aggression was not subjected to survival selection in either sex, but slow‐breathing females had a higher annual probability of survival as revealed by capture–mark–recapture analysis. We find no evidence for temporal fluctuations in selection, and thus conclude that directional selection (via different fitness components) acts on these two heritable personality traits. Our findings show that blue tit personality has predictable fitness consequences, but that facultative adjustment of an individual's personality to match the fitness maximum is likely constrained by the genetic architecture of personality. In the face of directional selection, the presence of heritable variation in personality suggests the existence of a trade‐off that we have not identified yet.",looked at aggression and did cross fostering to show that aggressive males have offspring more likely to recruit. both parents' personalities influence their reproductive success in the wild. ,Cyanistes caeruleus,blue tits,Aves,cross-fostering and heritability estimates in wild population,cross-foster,good example of cross-fostering and personality,skim,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

We illustrate this by applying recent quantitative genetic methods to spatial proximity data, a simple and widely collected primate social behavior, from adult rhesus macaques on Cayo Santiago. Our analysis shows that proximity measures are consistent across repeated measurements on individuals (repeatable) and that kin have similar mean measurements (heritable).

Beyond heritability, there are several other estimates that can be made with behavior genetic models of interest to primatologists. Some of these estimates are feasible with primate samples because they take advantage of the types of relatives available to compare in primate species and because most behaviors are expressed orders of magnitude more often and in a greater variety of contexts than morphological or life-history traits. The hypotheses that can be tested with these estimates are contrasted with hypotheses that will be difficult to achieve in primates because of sample size limitations. Feasible comparisons include the proportion of variance from interaction effects, the variation of genetic effects across environments, and the genetics of growth and development. Simulation shows that uncertainty of genetic parameters can be reduced by sampling each individual more than once.

All components were repeatable and heritable, with heritability estimates ranging from 0.14 to 0.35. We found no evidence of an association with reproductive output, measured either by infant survival or by interbirth interval, for any of the personality components.

Previous studies of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) examined the effects of genetic variation on expressed behavior and related neurobiological traits (heritability and/or genetic association) using a variety of study designs. Most of these prior studies examined genetic effects on the behavior of adults or adolescent rhesus macaques, not in young macaques early in development. To assess environmental and additive genetic variation in behavioral reactivity and response to novelty among infants, we investigated a range of behavioral traits in a large number (N = 428) of pedigreed infants born and housed in large outdoor corrals at the Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC). We recorded the behavior of each subject during a series of brief tests, involving exposure of each infant to a novel environment, to a social threat without the mother present, and to a novel environment with its mother present but sedated. We found significant heritability (h (2) ) for willingness to move away from the mother and explore a novel environment (h (2) = 0.25 +/- 0.13; P = 0.003). The infants also exhibited a range of heritable behavioral reactions to separation stress or to threat when the mother was not present (h (2) = 0.23 +/- 0.13-0.24 +/- 0.15, P < 0.01).

However, behavioral studies in farmed fish are still in their infancy and few automated screening methods have been developed. The aim of this study was to estimate heritability of behavioral responsiveness in farmed Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L, using automated screening of swimming activity of individual fish. The sampling included 320 fish (offspring of 15 dams and 14 sires) from the Norwegian national cod breeding program. Video recordings of individual fish were taken prior to and after a two minute period of mild stress (rapidly moving light). Observations were made on the percentage of time spent in the central zone of the tank and the swimming speed for each individual. Estimates of heritability for time spent in the central zone both before and after the stress period were intermediate (0.21 +/- 0.10 and 0.31 +/- 0.13, respectively). Similar estimates of heritability were found for swimming speed before and after the stress period (0.37 +/- 0.15 and 0.21 +/- 0.11, respectively). The genetic correlation of observed behavior before and after the stress period was strong for both the amount of time spent in the central zone and swimming speed (0.90 +/- 0.10 to 0.92 +/- 0.11), indicating that families rank similarly before and after the stress period. Results from a challenge test for vibriosis resistance on the same families were made available from the Norwegian national cod breeding program, and revealed slight negative correlations among estimated breeding values for vibriosis resistance and time spent in the central zone before the stress period, as well as for swimming speed before and after the stress period. Thus strong disease resistance may be associated genetically to low behavioral activity and low stress response.

Over the past century, quantitative genetic studies, using identical and fraternal twins, have demonstrated that differences in human personality are substantially heritable. We focus on more contemporary questions to which that basic observation has led. We examine whether differences in the heritability of personality are replicable across different traits, samples, and studies; how the heritability of personality relates to its reliability; and how behavior genetics can be employed in studies of validity, and we discuss the stability of personality in genetic and environmental variance. The appropriate null hypothesis in behavior genetics is not that genetic or environmental influence on personality is zero. Instead, we offer a phenotypic null hypothesis, which states that genetic variance is not an independent mechanism of individual differences in personality but rather a reflection of processes that are best conceptualized at the phenotypic level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

However, the mouse became the model of choice for researchers exploring the genetic underpinnings of addiction after the first mouse study was published demonstrating the capability of engineering the mouse genome through embryonic stem cell technology. The sequencing of the mouse genome and more recent re-sequencing of numerous inbred mouse strains have further cemented the status of mice as the premier mammalian organism for genetic studies. As a result, many of the behavioral paradigms initially developed and optimized for rats have been adapted to mice. However, numerous complex and interesting drug abuse-related behaviors that can be studied in rats are very difficult or impossible to adapt for use in mice, impeding the genetic dissection of those traits. Now, technological advances have removed many of the historical limitations of genetic studies in rats. For instance, the rat genome has been sequenced and many inbred rat strains are now being re-sequenced and outbred rat stocks are being used to fine-map QTLs. In addition, it is now possible to create ""knockout"" rats using zinc finger nucleases (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and related techniques. Thus, rats can now be used to perform quantitative genetic studies of sophisticated behaviors that have been difficult or impossible to study in mice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, whether a global dimension underlies individual differences in changes in different domains of cognition and whether global genetic influences on cognitive changes exist is less clear. We addressed these issues by applying multivariate growth curve models to longitudinal data from 857 individuals from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging, who had been measured on 11 cognitive variables representative of verbal, spatial, memory, and processing speed abilities up to 5 times over up to 16 years between ages 50 and 96 years. Between ages 50 and 65 years scores on different tests changed relatively independently of one another, and there was little evidence for strong underlying dimensions of change. In contrast, over the period between 65 and 96 years of age, there were strong interrelations among rates of change both within and across domains. During this age period, variability in rates of change were, on average, 52% domain-general, 8% domain-specific, and 39% test-specific. Quantitative genetic decomposition indicated that 29% of individual differences in a global domain-general dimension of cognitive changes during this age period were attributable to genetic influences, but some domain-specific genetic influences were also evident, even after accounting for domain-general contributions. These findings are consistent with a balanced global and domain-specific account of the genetics of cognitive aging.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

The degree of such plasticity can vary during an organism''s lifetime, but the factors promoting differential plastic responses at different ages or life stages remain poorly understood. Here we develop and analyze an evolutionary model to investigate how environmental information is optimally collected and translated into phenotypic adjustments at different ages. We demonstrate that plasticity must often be expected to vary with age in a nonmonotonic fashion. Early in life, it is generally optimal to delay phenotypic adjustments until sufficient information has been collected about the state of the environment to warrant a costly phenotypic adjustment. Toward the end of life, phenotypic adjustments are disfavored as well because their beneficial effects can no longer be fully reaped before death. Our analysis clarifies how patterns of age-dependent plasticity are shaped by the interplay of environmental uncertainty, the accuracy of perceived information, and the costs of phenotypic adjustments with life-history determinants such as the relative strengths of fecundity and viability selection experienced by the organism over its lifetime. We conclude by comparing our results with expectations for alternative mechanisms, including developmental constraints, that promote age-dependent plasticity.",plasticity must often be expected to vary with age. ,,,,evolutionary model,,shows patterns of age-dependent plasticity,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,not human
 J, HEREDITY," Wilson, AJAF Wilson, A. J.", Competition as a source of constraint on life history evolution in   natural populations,112,2014," Competition among individuals is central to our understanding of ecology and population dynamics. However, it could also have major implications for the evolution of resource-dependent life history traits (for example, growth, fecundity) that are important determinants of fitness in natural populations. This is because when competition occurs, the phenotype of each individual will be causally influenced by the phenotypes, and so the genotypes, of competitors. Theory tells us that indirect genetic effects arising from competitive interactions will give rise to the phenomenon of 'evolutionary environmental deterioration', and act as a source of evolutionary constraint on resource-dependent traits under natural selection. However, just how important this constraint is remains an unanswered question. This article seeks to stimulate empirical research in this area, first highlighting some patterns emerging from life history studies that are consistent with a competition-based model of evolutionary constraint, before describing several quantitative modelling strategies that could be usefully applied. A recurrent theme is that rigorous quantification of a competition's impact on life history evolution will require an understanding of the causal pathways and behavioural processes by which genetic (co) variance structures arise.

In this Review, I discuss experimental designs to detect the contribution of epistasis to quantitative trait phenotypes in model organisms. These studies indicate that epistasis is common, and that additivity can be an emergent property of underlying genetic interaction networks.

 J, INTERFACE FOCUS," Morozov, AAF Morozov, Andrew"," Modelling biological evolution: recent progress, current challenges and   future direction Introduction",3,2013," Mathematical modelling is widely recognized as a powerful and convenient theoretical tool for investigating various aspects of biological evolution and explaining the existing genetic complexity of the real world. It is increasingly apparent that understanding the key mechanisms involved in the processes of species biodiversity, natural selection and inheritance, patterns of animal behaviour and coevolution of species in complex ecological systems is simply impossible by means of laboratory experiments and field observations alone. Mathematical models are so important because they provide wide-ranging exploration of the problem without a need for experiments with biological systems-which are usually expensive, often require long time and can be potentially dangerous. However, as the number of theoretical works on modelling biological evolution is constantly accelerating each year as different mathematical frameworks and various aspects of evolutionary problems are considered, it is often hard to avoid getting lost in such an immense flux of publications. The aim of this issue of Interface Focus is to provide a useful guide to important recent findings in some key areas in modelling biological evolution, to refine the existing challenges and to outline possible future directions. In particular, the following topics are addressed here by world-leading experts in the modelling of evolution: (i) the origins of biodiversity observed in ecosystems and communities; (ii) evolution of decision-making by animals and the optimal strategy of populations; (iii) links between evolutionary and ecological processes across different time scales; (iv) quantification of biological information in evolutionary models; and (v) linking theoretical models with empirical data. Most of the works presented here are in fact contributed papers from the international conference 'Modelling Biological Evolution' (MBE 2013), which took place in Leicester, UK, in May 2013 and brought together theoreticians and empirical evolutionary biologists with the main aim of creating debates and productive discussions between them. Finally, we should emphasize that the individual papers in this issue are not limited to only one of the topics mentioned above, but often lie at the interface of them.",not relevant,,,,summary of special issue,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Method: We used a quantitative genetic model for the signal-sending and signal-receiving efforts of the two sexes. Mate-finding success is assumed to be a product of power functions of the signal sender's and signal receiver's investments.   Results: If mate-finding success strongly depends on the investments of both senders and receivers, only one sex evolves to send the signals; otherwise, both sexes evolve to emit signals. Males evolve to assume the role that more strongly affects mate-finding success, and to engage in mate-finding activities with more investments than females.","why do males evolve to produce mate attracting signals? if mate-finding success depends strongly on investments of both senders and receivers, one sex evolves to signal, otherwise both sexes evolve signals.

The purpose of this paper is to focus on a few implications and applications of these advances for understanding behavioral development. Quantitative genetics is genomic and will chart the course for molecular genomic research now that these two worlds of genetics are merging in the search for many genes of small effect. Although current attempts to identify specific genes have had limited success, known as the missing heritability problem, whole-genome sequencing will improve this situation by identifying all DNA sequence variations, including rare variants. Because the heritability of complex traits is caused by many DNA variants of small effect in the population, polygenic scores that are composites of hundreds or thousands of DNA variants will be used by developmentalists to predict children's genetic risk and resilience. The most far-reaching advance will be the widespread availability of whole-genome sequence for children, which means that developmentalists would no longer need to obtain DNA or to genotype children in order to use genomic information in research or in the clinic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

However, despite theoretical predictions that life-history trade-offs may cause and maintain personality differences, our understanding of the evolutionary ecology of personality remains poor, especially in long-lived species where trade-offs and senescence have been shown to be stronger. Furthermore, although much theoretical and empirical work assumes selection shapes variation in personalities, studies exploring the genetic underpinnings of personality traits are rare.

Using generalized linear mixed models in a Bayesian framework, we show that boldness is highly repeatable and heritable. We also find strong differences in boldness between breeding colonies, which vary in size and density, suggesting birds are shyer in more dense colonies. These results demonstrate that in this seabird population, boldness is both heritable and repeatable and highlights the potential for ecological and evolutionary processes to shape personality traits in species with varying life-history strategies.","measure behavioral response to human approach using glmm to show that boldness is highly repeatable and heritable, with strong differences among breeding colonies.

The rate of initial response, timing of selection limit, and height of the plateau varied significantly between sexes and among the four selected lines. Analyses of litter size and realized selection differentials seem to rule out counterposing natural selection as a cause of the selection limits. Animal-model analyses showed that although the additive genetic variance was significantly lower in selected than control lines, both before and after the limits, the decrease was not sufficient to explain the limits. Moreover, directional selection promoted a negative covariance between additive and maternal genetic variance over the first 10 generations.

 J, JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY," Matute, DRAF Matute, D. R.", The role of founder effects on the evolution of reproductive isolation,26,2013," Several theories argue that large changes in allele frequencies through genetic drift after a small founding population becomes allopatrically isolated can lead to significant changes in reproductive isolation and thus trigger the origin of new species. For this reason, founder speciation has been proposed as a potent force in the generation of new species. Nonetheless, the relative importance of such founder effects' remains largely untested. In this report, I used experimental evolution to create one thousand replicates that underwent an extreme bottleneck and to study whether founder effects can lead to an increase in reproductive isolation in Drosophila yakuba. Even though the most common outcome of inbreeding is extinction, founder effects can lead to increased premating reproductive isolation in a very small proportion of cases. Changes in reproductive isolation after a founding population bottleneck are similar to changes in other phenotypic traits, in which inbreeding might displace the mean phenotypic value and substantially increase the phenotypic variance. This increase in phenotypic variance does not confer an increase in the response to selection for reproductive isolation in artificial selection experiments, indicating that the increased phenotypic variance is not caused by increases in additive genetic variance. These results also demonstrate that, similar to morphological and life-history traits, behavioural traits can be affected by inbreeding and genetic drift.","inbreeding generally led to extinction, but founder effects can elad to increased premating reproductive isolation.

Although recent progress has been made in understanding the genetic architecture underlying morphological evolution, behavioral evolution is poorly understood. Here, we use the Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, to study the genetic basis for convergent evolution of feeding posture. When river-dwelling surface fish became entrapped in the caves, they were confronted with dramatic changes in the availability and type of food source and in their ability to perceive it. In this setting, multiple independent populations of cavefish exhibit an altered feeding posture compared with their ancestral surface forms. We determined that this behavioral change in feeding posture is not due to changes in cranial facial morphology, body depth, or to take advantage of the expansion in the number of taste buds. Quantitative genetic analysis demonstrates that two different cave populations have evolved similar feeding postures through a small number of genetic changes, some of which appear to be distinct. This work indicates that independently evolved populations of cavefish can evolve the same behavioral traits to adapt to similar environmental challenges by modifying different sets of genes.",convergent evolution fo feeding posture due to distinct genetic chagnes that differ among populations. ,Astyanax mexicanus,Mexican cavefish,Actinopterygii,investigate genetic basis of behaviors,"F2 cross, QTL mapping",good example of looking at genetic basis of behavior,yes,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

In invertebrates, DA has been suggested to be non-adaptive. In vertebrates, there has been a wealth of research linking morphological asymmetry to behavioural lateralisation.

We estimate quantitative genetic variation of fetal limb asymmetry in a large dataset of rabbits. Our results showed a low but highly significant level of DA that is partially under genetic control for all traits, with forelimbs displaying higher levels of asymmetry.

One possibility holds that correlational selection can generate and maintain behavioural syndrome if certain behavioural combinations enjoy greater fitness than other combinations. Here we test this correlational selection hypothesis by comparing behavioural syndrome structure with a multivariate fitness surface based on reproductive success of male water striders. We measured the structure of a behavioural syndrome including dispersal ability, exploration behaviour, latency to remount and sex recognition sensitivity in males. We then measured the relationship between these behaviours and mating success in a range of sex ratio environments. Despite the presence of some significant correlational selection, behavioural syndrome structure was not associated with correlational selection on behaviours. Although we cannot conclusively reject the correlational selection hypothesis, our evidence suggests that correlational selection and resulting linkage disequilibrium might not be responsible for maintaining the strong correlations between behaviours. Instead, we suggest alternative ways in which this behavioural syndrome may have arisen and outline the need for physiological and quantitative genetic tests of these suggestions.","significant correlationsal selection among mating traits and exploration traits, but behavioral syndrom structure was not associated with correlational selection on behaviors.

In this study, an approach was followed to select molecular biomarkers (quantitative gene expressions) to predict induced acid resistance after exposure to various mild stresses, Le. exposure to sublethal concentrations of salt, acid and hydrogen peroxide during 5 min to 60 min. Gene expression patterns of unstressed and mildly stressed cells of Bacillus weihenstephanensis were correlated to their acid resistance (3D value) which was estimated after exposure to lethal acid conditions. Among the twenty-nine candidate biomarkers, 12 genes showed expression patterns that were correlated either linearly or non-linearly to acid resistance, while for the 17 other genes the correlation remains to be determined. The selected genes represented two types of biomarkers, (i) four direct biomarker genes (lexA, spxA, narL, bkdR) for which expression patterns upon mild stress treatment were linearly correlated to induced acid resistance; and (ii) nine long-acting biomarker genes (spxA, BcerKBAB4_0325, katA, trxB, codY, lad, BcerKBAB4_1716, BcerKBAB4_2108, relA) which were transiently up-regulated during mild stress exposure and correlated to increased acid resistance overtime.

Yet, over the last few decades the debate on the limits between the two disorders has continued, even though ADHD and ASD are undoubtedly clinically and cognitively different phenotypes, as demonstrated by the simple fact that they have been defined in clearly different ways. Thus, from a perspective anchored in a purely phenomenological view, there would be no grounds whatsoever on which to question the independence between the two disorders. Since, at the present time, the discussion on the convergence between ADHD and ASD cannot be considered to have been solved, this study aims to take the data available from genetics as the basis on which to review the nosological position of the two disorders. The main studies that have addressed this issue are reviewed. The data collected agree on a genetic overlap between ADHD and ASD, which is influenced by common molecular mechanisms that affect the two disorders at the same time.

One mechanism that could allow such variation to persist within populations is the presence of tradeoffs between aerobic and anaerobic performance, such that individuals with a high capacity for one type of performance have a reduced capacity for the other. We investigated this possibility in European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax, each measured for a battery of indicators of maximum locomotor performance. Aerobic traits comprised active metabolic rate, aerobic scope for activity, maximum aerobic swimming speed, and stride length, using a constant acceleration test. Anaerobic traits comprised maximum speed during an escape response, maximum sprint speed, and maximum anaerobic burst speed during constant acceleration. The data provided evidence of significant variation in performance among individuals, but there was no evidence of any trade-offs among any traits of aerobic versus anaerobic swimming performance. Furthermore, the anaerobic traits were not correlated significantly among each other, despite relying on the same muscular structures. Thus, the variation observed may reflect trade-offs with other morphological, physiological or behavioural traits.","variation in performance among individuals in aerobic and anaerobic traits (including behaviors), but show no trade-offs",Dicentrarchus labrax,European seabass,Actinopterygii,measured traits and calculated variation,phenotypes,not really quantitative genetics,no,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,not human

Plovers placed nests in microsites (1 m(2) scale) with more pebbles and less bare mud and vegetation than what was available in the environment, indicating long-term selection for these features. Linear (directional selection) effects were stronger than quadratic (stabilizing or disruptive) effects in 3 of 4 years and in the analysis of all data. In the combined 4-year sample, significant directional selection occurred in the opposite direction than that present when comparing used and available sites.

Repeatability of nest-site preferences was low and nonsignificant. Neither successful nor unsuccessful pairs chose significantly different nest-site characteristics in subsequent nesting attempts, but options for moving to different nest sites may be limited by interannual site fidelity.

In Blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), we show that age hierarchies are predominantly caused by incubation preclutch completion, such that last laid eggs hatch later than early laid eggs. However, after statistically controlling for incubation behavior late laid eggs are shown to hatch more quickly than early laid eggs reducing the amount of asynchrony. By experimentally switching early and late laid eggs between nests on the day they were laid, we controlled for the effect of differential incubation and found that the faster hatching times of late laid eggs remains. Chicks that hatched earlier were heavier and had higher probability of fledgling, and chicks that hatched from experimental eggs had patterns of growth and survival consistent with this. Egg mass explained a small part of this variation, but the remainder must be due to egg composition. These results are consistent with the idea that intrinsic differences between eggs across the laying sequence serve to mitigate the effects of age-related hierarchies.

Generally, the effects of genes and prenatal investment are confounded and the interpretation given to such experiments is largely dependent on the interests of the researcher. Using a large-scale well-controlled experiment on a wild population of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), we are able to partition variation in body mass across ontogeny into the effects of genes and the effects of between-clutch variation in egg characteristics. We show that although egg effects are important early in ontogeny they quickly dissipate, suggesting that the genetic interpretation of cross-fostering experiments may be preferable for many types of trait. However, the heritability of body mass is smaller than has previously been reported. Our results suggest that this is due to a combination of controlling postnatal environmental effects more carefully and accounting for viability selection operating early in ontogeny.","not behavior

Specifically, we study the relationship between the observed covariance structures, on the one hand, and the underlying genetic and environmental influences giving rise to such structures, on the other. We note that this relationship may be such that it hampers obtaining a clear estimate of dimensionality using standard tools for dimensionality assessment alone. One situation in which dimensionality assessment may be impeded is that in which genetic and environmental influences, of which the observed covariance structure is a function, differ from each other in structure and dimensionality. We demonstrate that in such situations settling dimensionality issues may be problematic, and propose using quantitative genetic modeling to uncover the (possibly different) dimensionalities of the underlying genetic and environmental structures.

 J, ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR," McGhee, KE   Travis, JAF McGhee, Katie E.   Travis, Joseph", Heritable variation underlies behavioural types in the mating context in   male bluefin killifish,86,2013," In many species, consistent behavioural differences among individuals are linked to fitness variation. Determining the environmental and genetic factors that mould these behavioural types is crucial to understanding how behaviours might respond to selection. Male bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, show extensive consistent behavioural variation in their levels of courtship, male-directed aggression and female-directed aggression, resulting in a range of fitness-related behavioural types coexisting within a population. To determine whether the behavioural components underlying a male's stable behavioural type in the mating context are heritable and genetically correlated, we performed paternal half-sib crosses. Using animal models, we found that all three of these mating behaviours were moderately heritable (h(2) = 0.17-0.29) and courtship behaviour was also heritable as a binomial trait (court yes/no: h(2) = 0.50). Including effects of dam identity/common rearing environment experienced by full sibs decreased model fit, suggesting that early social interactions might contribute to behavioural types. In addition, we found evidence consistent with the possibility that the positive phenotypic correlations among mating behaviours are underlain by positive genetic correlations. Thus, it is possible that the seemingly maladaptive aggression that males direct towards females during social interactions persist due to genetic constraints and direct selection on male-directed aggression and courtship behaviour.

Here, we studied a captive population of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) in which selection lines for male courtship rate have been established. We measure BMR in these lines to see whether selection on male sexual activity would change BMR as a potentially correlated trait. We find that the genetic correlation between courtship rate and BMR is practically zero, indicating that the two traits can evolve independently of each other. Interestingly, we find that the heritability of BMR in our population (h(2) = 0.45) is markedly higher than was previously reported for a captive zebra finch population from Norway. A comparison of the two studies shows that additive genetic variance in BMR has been largely depleted in the Norwegian population, especially the genetic variance in BMR that is independent of body mass. In our population, the slope of BMR increase with body mass differs not only between the sexes but also between the six selection lines, which we tentatively attribute to genetic drift and/or founder effects being strong in small populations. Our study therefore highlights two things. First, the evolvability of BMR may be less constrained by genetic correlations and lack of independent genetic variation than previously described. Second, genetic drift in small populations can rapidly lead to different evolvabilities across populations.","basal metabolic rate was the focus, in zebrafinches, and found heritability is quite high.

J.", Exploring patterns of variation in clutch size-density reaction norms in   a wild passerine bird,26,2013," Negative density dependence of clutch size is a ubiquitous characteristic of avian populations and is partly due to within-individual phenotypic plasticity. Yet, very little is known about the extent to which individuals differ in their degree of phenotypic plasticity, whether such variation has a genetic basis and whether level of plasticity can thus evolve in response to selection. Using 18years of data of a Dutch great tit population (Parus major), we show that females reduced clutch size with increasing population density (slopes of the reaction norms), differed strongly in their average clutch size (elevations of the reaction norms) at the population-mean density and that the latter variation was partly heritable. In contrast, we could not detect individual variation in phenotypic plasticity (IxE'). Level of plasticity is thus not likely to evolve in response to selection in this population. Observed clutch sizes deviated more from the estimated individual reaction norms in certain years and densities, implying that the within-individual between-year variance (so-called residual variance) of clutch size was heterogeneous with respect to these factors. Given the observational nature of this study, experimental manipulation of density is now warranted to confirm the causality of the observed density effects. Our analyses demonstrate that failure to acknowledge this heterogeneity would have inflated the estimate of IxE' and led to misinterpretation of the data. This paper thereby emphasizes the fact that heterogeneity in residuals can provide biologically insightful information about the ecological processes underlying the data.","not behavior

We used a quantitative genetic breeding design to measure the critical swimming speed (U-crit) of offspring (15 and 18 weeks post-hatch) from 36 families of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), a species with a nonresource-based mating system. We investigated the roles of dam, sire, and dam x sire on offspring U-crit, and estimated contributions of additive and nonadditive genetic effects and maternal effects to phenotypic variation in U-crit at both ages. We also used existing 'high-survival' and 'low-survival' lines of Chinook to determine if these two lines show differences in U-crit. At 15 weeks, there were no significant genetic effects, but at 18 weeks there were significant sire effects. Furthermore, additive genetic effects increased from 26 to 100 % from 15 to 18 weeks post-hatch. The two survival lines also showed differences in U-crit at 18 weeks post-hatch, with higher U-crit associated with ""high-survival"" sires. Collectively, the present study provides evidence for increasing importance of paternal identity (additive genetic variation) on swimming as juvenile offspring age. Given that mortality is high in young Pacific salmon and swimming ability is crucial, the sire effects could potentially shape survival though subsequent developmental stages.

We applied a multivariate approach to reveal the mechanistic pathways by which variation in exploratory and aggressive behaviour is translated into variation in reproductive success in a natural population of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus. Using path analysis, we demonstrate a key role for provisioning behaviour in mediating the link between personality and reproductive success (number of fledged offspring). Aggressive males fed their nestlings at lower rates than less aggressive individuals. At the same time, their low parental investment was associated with increased female effort, thereby positively affecting fledgling production. Whereas male exploratory behaviour was unrelated to provisioning behaviour and reproductive success, fast-exploring females fed their offspring at higher rates and initiated breeding earlier, thus increasing reproductive success. Our findings provide strong support for specific mechanistic pathways linking components of behavioural syndromes to reproductive success. Importantly, relationships between behavioural phenotypes and reproductive success were obscured when considering simple bivariate relationships, underlining the importance of adopting multivariate views and statistical tools as path analysis to the study of behavioural evolution.",key role for provisioning behavior in mediating link between personality and reproductive success. ,Cyanistes caeruleus,blue tits,Aves,path analysis,pedigree,not really quantitative genetics but does link behavioral phenotypes to fitness.,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Moreover, we find a strongly positive genetic correlation between local dispersal distance and exploration rate, despite a weak and non-significant phenotypic correlation. These findings demonstrate a potentially important behavioural mechanism underlying heritable differences in local dispersal and highlight the potential for concerted evolution of dispersal and animal personality in response to selection.","geentic coupling of local dispersal and exploratory behavior, a key personality trait. find quantiatitve genetic variation for both traits and a strong positive correlation",Parus major,great tits,Aves,multi-generation pedigree of free-living individuals,pedigree,"despite weak phenotypic correlation, strong genetic correlation between personality traits",skim,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,not human

To date, evolutionary studies of brain size variation have mainly utilized comparative methods applied at the level of species or higher taxa. However, these studies suffer from the difficulty of separating causality from correlation. In the other extreme, studies of brain plasticity have focused mainly on within-population patterns. Between these extremes lie interpopulational studies, focusing on brain size variation among populations of the same species that occupy different habitats or selective regimes. These studies form a rapidly growing field of investigations which can help us to understand brain evolution by providing a test bed for ideas born out of interspecific studies, as well as aid in uncovering the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors shaping variation in brain size and architecture. Aside from providing the first in depth review of published intraspecific studies of brain size variation, we discuss the prospects embedded with interpopulational studies of brain size variation. In particular, the following topics are identified as deserving further attention: (i) studies focusing on disentangling the contributions of genes, environment, and their interactions on brain variation within and among populations, (ii) studies applying quantitative genetic tools to evaluate the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors on brain features at different ontogenetic stages, (iii) apart from utilizing simple gross estimates of brain size, future studies could benefit from use of neuroanatomical, neurohistological, and/or molecular methods in characterizing variation in brain size and architecture.","not behavior

Among the evolutionary mechanisms proposed to account for this diversity, two processes in particular have generated considerable interest. On the one hand, females may exploit postcopulatory mechanisms of selection to favour males with preferred genital traits (cryptic female choice; CFC), while on the other hand females may evolve structures or behaviours that mitigate the direct costs imposed by male genitalia (sexual conflict; SC). A critical but rarely explored assumption underlying both processes is that male and female reproductive traits coevolve, either via the classic Fisherian model of preference-trait coevolution (CFC) or through sexually antagonistic selection (SC). Here, we provide evidence for this prediction in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a polyandrous livebearing fish in which males transfer sperm internally to females via consensual and forced matings. Our results from a paternal half-sibling breeding design reveal substantial levels of additive genetic variation underlying male genital size and morphology-two traits known to predict mating success during non-consensual matings. Our subsequent finding that physically interacting female genital traits exhibit corresponding levels of genetic (co)variation reveals the potential intersexual coevolutionary dynamics of male and female genitalia, thereby fulfilling a fundamental assumption underlying CFC and SC theory.","not behavior

Using eight components of parental care in 400 bird species from 89 avian families that represent the relative contribution of male vs. female to a particular type of care, we show that some components evolve in a highly correlated manner, whereas others exhibit low (or no) phylogenetic correlation. Correlations were stronger within types of parental activity (brooding, feeding, guarding) than within stages of the breeding cycle (incubation, prefledging care, post-fledging care). A phylogenetically corrected cluster analysis identified two groups of parental care components that evolved in a correlated fashion: one group included incubation and brooding, whereas the other group comprised of the remaining components. The two groups of components provide working hypotheses for follow-up studies to test the underlying genetic, developmental and ecological co-evolutionary mechanism between male and female care.

This is because life history and personality have become implied as part of integrative pace-of-life syndromes. Immune defense is one of the traits that have been suggested to associate with personality traits, such as boldness, mainly because behavioral types may differ in parasite encounter rates. Here, we quantified the narrow-sense heritabilities (h(2) V-A/(V-A V-R)) and genetic (r(A)) and phenotypic (r(P)) correlations between 2 measures of behavior (overall boldness and defreezing, i.e., recovery from disturbance-induced immobility), 1 measure of immune function (encapsulation response), and 2 life-history traits (body mass and maturation time) using the western stutter-trilling cricket, Gryllus integer. All nonbehavioral traits showed strong heritabilities (range: encapsulation response and life-history: h(2) 0.420.84), whereas behaviors were only marginally heritable (h(2) 0.060.11). Boldness and encapsulation were positively associated, and defreezing and body mass were negatively associated phenotypically, whereas only defreezing was positively genetically correlated with encapsulation. However, the lack of significant additive genetic variation in defreezing suggests that the genetic correlation may be an artifact and therefore, that there were only environmentally induced phenotypic correlations between behaviors and other measured traits. Life-history traits and encapsulation were positively phenotypically associated and these associations were mostly genetically underpinned. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that life history is structured in an evolutionarily significant pace-of-life syndrome, but suggest that behavior does not intrinsically integrate with such life-history variation.","narrow sense heritabilities calculated between behavior, immune function, and life history traits, and behaviors were only marginally heritable, compared to other traits. boldness and immune response were positively associated. only environmentally induced phenotypic correlations between behaviors and other measured traits. behavior does not intrinsically integrate with life hiostory variation",Gryllus integer,western stutter-trilling cricket,Insecta,quantitative genetic experiment,half/full-sib,behavior and life history variation do not necessarily integrate,maybe,x,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,not human

For instance, parasites often induce changes in the behaviour of their host to maximize their own fitness, yet the quantitative genetic basis for behavioural manipulation has not been fully demonstrated.

The red spot on the lower mandible in adult gulls is one of the best-known examples of a signal triggering chick begging. We examined whether the begging response of chicks (pecking for food and the chatter call for drawing parental attention) was affected by the spot size within the natural range of variation on a dummy head. Using a cross-fostering experiment, we examined whether these responses covary with the size of the genetic or social parent's spot. We found that the natural variation in size of this parental signal strongly influenced intensity of chick begging. Pecking increased when chicks were stimulated by a larger red spot. Additionally, pecking intensity increased in chicks reared by mothers with a large red spot, suggesting that this begging component is influenced by previous experience. In contrast, chick hatching order affected the number of chatter calls produced in relation to the size of the red spot on the dummy, suggesting the presence of different begging strategies according to brood hierarchy. The differential call response to a small/large red spot on the dummy was positively correlated with the original mothers' red spot size and negatively with that of the original fathers.

Although an intuitively attractive concept, issues of accounting for fitness, and correctly assigning it to the appropriate individual make this approach difficult to implement. The direct fitness approach has been suggested as a means of modeling kin selection while avoiding these issues. Whereas Hamilton's inclusive fitness approach assigns to the focal individual the fitness effects of its behavior on other related individuals, the direct fitness approach assigns the fitness effects of other actors to the focal individual. Contextual analysis was independently developed as a quantitative genetic approach for measuring multilevel selection in natural populations. Although the direct fitness approach and contextual analysis come from very different traditions, both methods rely on the same underlying equation, with the primary difference between the two approaches being that the direct fitness approach uses fitness optimization modeling, whereas with contextual analysis, the same equation is used to solve for the change in fitness associated with a change in phenotype when the population is away from the optimal phenotype.",not useful,,,,review of kin selection models,,contextual analysis meets direct fitness methods,no,,,,,,,,,,,x,x,,,,,,not human

Multilevel selection significantly reduced mortality (6.6% K vs. 8.5% R) and increased weight (1.30 g/MG K vs. 0.13 g/MG R) resulting in response an order of magnitude greater with Kin than Random. Thus, multilevel selection was effective in reducing detrimental social interactions, which contributed to improved weight gain. The observed rates of response did not differ significantly from expected, demonstrating that current theory is adequate to explain multilevel selection response. Based on estimated genetic parameters, group selection would always be superior to any other combination of multilevel selection. Further, near optimal results could be attained using multilevel selection if 20% of the weight was on the group component regardless of group composition. Thus, in nature the conditions for multilevel selection to be effective in bringing about social change maybe common.

This is because evolution can only operate on traits whose variation is transmitted, i.e. traits that are heritable. The discovery of genetic inheritance has led to a semantic shift, resulting in the tendency to consider that only genes are inherited across generations. Today, however, concepts of heredity are being broadened again to integrate the accruing evidence of non-genetic inheritance, and many evolutionary biologists are calling for the inclusion of non-genetic inheritance into an inclusive evolutionary synthesis. Here, we focus on social heredity and its role in the inheritance of behavioral traits. We discuss quantitative genetics methods that might allow us to disentangle genetic and non-genetic transmission in natural populations with known pedigrees. We then propose an experimental design based on cross-fostering among animal cultures, environments and families that has the potential to partition inherited phenotypic variation into socially (i.e. culturally) and genetically inherited components. This approach builds towards a new conceptual framework based on the use of an extended version of the animal model of quantitative genetics to integrate genetic and cultural components of behavioral inheritance.",quantiatative genetic methods might allow us to disentangle genetic and non-genetic transmission in natural populations with known pedigrees and propose an experimental design to test for social inheritance,,,,review/position paper,,probably not very relevant - focus on social heredity,probably not,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,x,,not human

Evidence is accumulating that individuals from the same population differ in the degree and extent of this form of phenotypic plasticity. We here discuss how such between-individual differences in behavioural plasticity can result from additive and interactive effects of genetic make-up and past environmental conditions, and under which conditions natural selection might favour this form of between-individual variation. We highlight how spatial or temporal variation in the environment, in combination with competition among individuals, can promote adaptive individual differences in plasticity; and we detail how differences in plasticity can emerge as a result of selection pressures induced by social interactions or as a response to between-individual differences in state. We further discuss both ecological and evolutionary consequences of individual differences in plasticity. We outline, for example, how individual differences in plasticity can have knock-on effects on the rate of evolution; and how such differences can enhance the stability and persistence of populations.

Genetic variation in such plasticity is common, but the evolution of context-dependent transition timing may be constrained by information reliability, lag-time and developmental constraints. We studied the genetic architecture of hatching plasticity in embryos of the red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) in response to simulated predator attacks using a series of paternal and maternal half-sibs from a captive breeding colony of wild-collected animals. We compared the developmental timing of induced early hatching across sibships and estimated cross-environment genetic correlations between induced and spontaneous hatching traits. Additive genetic variance for induced early hatching was very low, indicating a constraint on the short-term evolution of earlier hatching timing. This constraint is likely related to the maturation of the hatching mechanism. The most plastic genotypes produced the most extreme spontaneous hatching phenotypes, indicating that developmental range, per se, is not constrained. Cross-environment genetic correlation in hatching timing was negligible, so the evolution of spontaneous hatching in this species has not depended on the evolution of risk-induced hatching and vice versa.","not behavior

However, the genetic variance of such traits may vary over the life span. Using a long-term study (1994-2008) of arrival date from spring migration in the long-lived common tern (Sterna hirundo), we examined changes in variances of this key phenological trait across reproductive stages (before, during, and after the first breeding event). Based on 5315 records from 1232 individuals, arrival date at the breeding grounds exhibited significant declines in phenotypic and additive genetic variances across reproductive stages. Canalization of this phenological trait and selective disappearances across reproductive stages are hypotheses to explain these declines. Canalization was revealed by significant reductions in phenotypic and additive genetic variations at progressive reproductive stages. Viability analyses rejected the selective disappearance hypothesis. Heritability of arrival date also declined with reproductive stage (from 0.23 to 0.11). Finally, arrival date was under fecundity selection for experienced breeders, suggesting a current influence on canalization via fecundity selection. These results highlight how fine-tuned quantitative genetic investigations can reveal canalization in behavioral traits, reflecting past and present selective forces, and refining predictive evolutionary potential.",revealed canalization of arrival date using pedigreed population.

Patricia", Clutch identity and predator-induced hatching affect behavior and   development in a leaf-breeding treefrog,171,2013," For species with complex life cycles, transitions between life stages result in niche shifts that are often associated with evolutionary trade-offs. When conditions across life stages are unpredictable, plasticity in niche shift timing may be adaptive; however, factors associated with clutch identity (e.g., genetic or maternal) may influence the effects of such plasticity. The red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) is an ideal organism for investigating the effects of genetics and life stage switch point timing because embryos exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity in hatching time. In this study, we evaluated the effects of experimentally manipulated hatching time and clutch identity on antipredator behavior of tadpoles and on developmental traits of metamorphs, including larval period, mass, SVL, and jumping ability. We found that in the presence of dragonfly nymph predator cues at 21 days post-oviposition, tadpoles reduced both their activity level and height in the water column. Furthermore, early-hatched tadpoles were less active than late-hatched tadpoles of the same age. This difference in behavior patterns of early- and late-hatched tadpoles may represent an adaptive response due to a longer period of susceptibility to odonate predators for early-hatched tadpoles, or it may be a carry-over effect mediated by early exposure to an environmental stressor (i.e., induction of early hatching). We also found that hatching time affected both behavioral traits and developmental traits, but its effect on developmental traits varied significantly among clutches. This study shows that a single early-life event may influence a suite of factors during subsequent life stages and that some of these effects appear to be dependent on clutch identity. This interaction may represent an evolutionary response to a complex life cycle and unpredictable environments, regardless of whether the clutch differences are due to additive genetic variance or maternal effects.",life history traits including activity level differed among clutches but also between early and late hatchers,Agalychnis callidryas,red-eyed treefrog,Amphibia,full-sib two treatment design,full-sib,tadpoles reduced activity in response to predator and found difference in behavior of early and late hatched tadpoles.,probably not,,,,,,,x,x,,,,,,,,m,,not human

As a study species, we chose the brown trout (Salmo trutta; Salmonidae).

Svensson, Erik I.", Polyandry and alternative mating tactics,368,2013," Many species in the animal kingdom are characterized by alternative mating tactics (AMTs) within a sex. In males, such tactics include mate guarding versus sneaking behaviours, or territorial versus female mimicry. Although AMTs can occur in either sex, they have been most commonly described in males. This sex bias may, in part, reflect the increased opportunity for sexual selection that typically exists in males, which can result in a higher probability that AMTs evolve in that sex. Consequently, females and polyandry can play a pivotal role in governing the reproductive success associated with male AMTs and in the evolutionary dynamics of the tactics. In this review, we discuss polyandry and the evolution of AMTs. First, we define AMTs and review game theoretical and quantitative genetic approaches used to model their evolution. Second, we review several examples of AMTs, highlighting the roles that genes and environment play in phenotype expression and development of the tactics, as well as empirical approaches to differentiating among the mechanisms. Third, ecological and genetic constraints to the evolution of AMTs are discussed. Fourth, we speculate on why female AMTs are less reported on in the literature than male tactics. Fifth, we examine the effects of AMTs on breeding outcomes and female fitness, and as a source, and possibly also a consequence, of sexual conflict. We conclude by suggesting a new model for the evolution of AMTs that incorporates both environmental and genetic effects, and discuss some future avenues of research.","review of alternative mating tactics, including quantitative genetic models and genetic constraints",,,,review,,I think I've read this before - it's probably not all that relevant to the chapter,later,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,not human

Individuals were genotyped with microsatellites, single nucleotide polymorphisms and four well-known flowering genes (FRI, FLC, CRY2 and PHYC). Phenotypic and genotypic data were used to conduct QSTFST comparisons. Life-history traits varied significantly among- and within-populations. Flowering time also showed substantial within- and among-population variation as well as significant genotypexenvironment interactions among the various conditions. Individuals bearing FRI truncations exhibited reduced recruitment in field conditions and differential flowering time behavior across experimental conditions, suggesting that FRI contributes to the observed significant genotypexenvironment interactions. Flowering time estimated in field conditions was the only trait showing significantly higher quantitative genetic differentiation than neutral genetic differentiation values. Overall, our results show that these A.thaliana populations are genetically more differentiated for flowering time than for neutral markers, suggesting that flowering time is likely to be under divergent selection.",not relevant,Arabidopsis,plant,plant,,,plant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Using a large set of records (maximum n = 977 mothers, 6,240 offspring), strong maternal effects can be identified early in development but they rapidly burn off as offspring age and mothers become less consistent buffers from increasingly prominent environmental variation. The different ways behavioral ecologists and animal breeders have defined and studied maternal effects can be subsumed, and even blended, within the quantitative genetic framework.

Quantitative genetic modeling was used to explore common and unique genetic and environmental influences on both family environment and later depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms at age 12 were significantly heritable. Moderate genetic effects influenced parenting style and family chaos at the age of 9, indicating gene-environment correlation. There were significant genetic correlations between family environment and depressive symptoms. There was some evidence of a Gene x Environment interaction, with stronger genetic effects on depressive symptoms for children with more suboptimal family environment. There was an Environment x Environment interaction, with effects of nonshared environment on depressive symptoms stronger for twins with more adverse parenting experiences. There is some evidence for gene-environment correlation between aspects of family environment in middle childhood and subsequent depressive symptoms.

Dominance and aggression are ubiquitous traits that are selectively advantageous in many animal societies and have the potential to impact the evolutionary trajectory of animal populations. Here we provide age- and sex-specific estimates of additive genetic and environmental components of variance for dominance rank and aggression rate in a free-living, human-habituated bird population subject to natural selection. We use a long-term data set on individually marked greylag geese (Anser anser) and show that phenotypic variation in dominance-related behaviours contains significant additive genetic variance, parental effects and permanent environment effects. The relative importance of these variance components varied between age and sex classes, whereby the most pronounced differences concerned nongenetic components. In particular, parental effects were larger in juveniles of both sexes than in adults. In paired adults, the partner's identity had a larger influence on male dominance rank and aggression rate than in females. In sex- and age-specific estimates, heritabilities did not differ significantly between age and sex classes. Adult dominance rank was only weakly genetically correlated between the sexes, leading to considerably higher heritabilities in sex-specific estimates than across sexes. We discuss these patterns in relation to selection acting on dominance rank and aggression in different life history stages and sexes and suggest that different adaptive optima could be a mechanism for maintaining genetic variation in dominance-related traits in free-living animal populations.","age- and sex-specific estimates of additive genetic and environmental components of variance for domminance rank and aggression rank.

The study of phenotypic plasticity in the wild can shed new light on the ultimate objectives (1) whether plasticity itself can evolve or is constrained by its genetic architecture, and (2) whether plasticity is associated to other traits, including fitness (selection). I describe the main statistical approach for how repeated records of individuals and a description of the environment (E) allow quantification of variation in plasticity across individuals (IxE) and genotypes (GxE) in wild populations. Based on a literature review of life-history and behavioural studies on plasticity in the wild, I discuss the present state of the two objectives listed above. Few studies have quantified GxE of labile traits in wild populations, and it is likely that power to detect statistically significant GxE is lacking. Apart from the issue of whether it is heritable, plasticity tends to correlate with average trait expression (not fully supported by the few genetic estimates available) and may thus be evolutionary constrained in this way. Individual-specific estimates of plasticity tend to be related to other traits of the individual (including fitness), but these analyses may be anti-conservative because they predominantly concern stats-on-stats. Despite the increased interest in plasticity in wild populations, the putative lack of power to detect GxE in such populations hinders achieving general insights. I discuss possible steps to invigorate the field by moving away from simply testing for presence of GxE to analyses that 'scale up' to population level processes and by the development of new behavioural theory to identify quantitative genetic parameters which can be estimated.",describes main statistical approach for how repeated records of individuals and a description of the environment allow quantification of individual plasticity (IxE) and genotypes (GxE) in populations,,,,review,,plasticity tends to correlate with average trait expression and may be constrainedin this way.

Optimal sampling schemes to accurately estimate (with sufficient power) a wide range of repeatabilities and key (co)variance components, such as between- and within-individual correlations, are detailed.

For flexible behavioral traits, however, solutions to adaptive problems are reached not only by genetic evolution but also by behavioral changes within an individual's lifetime, via psychological mechanisms such as learning. Standard optimality approaches ignore these mechanisms, implicitly assuming that they do not constrain the expression of adaptive behavior. This assumption, which we dub the behavioral gambit, is sometimes wrong: evolved psychological mechanisms can prevent animals from behaving optimally in specific situations. To understand the functional basis of behavior, we would do better by considering the underlying mechanisms, rather than the behavioral outcomes they produce, as the target of selection. This change of focus yields new, testable predictions about evolutionary equilibria, the development of behavior, and the properties of cognitive systems. Studies on the evolution of learning rules hint at the potential insights to be gained, but such mechanism-based approaches are underexploited. We highlight three future research priorities: (1) systematic theoretical analysis of the evolutionary properties of learning rules; (2) detailed empirical study of how animals learn in nonforaging contexts; and (3) analysis of individual differences in learning rules and their associated fitness consequences.",evolution of learning rules - call for better understanding of how flexible behavioral traits can change over a lifetime,,,,review,,not really relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,not human

Jeffery, William R.", Evolution of an adaptive behavior and its sensory receptors promotes eye   regression in blind cavefish,10,2012," Background: How and why animals lose eyesight during adaptation to the dark and food-limited cave environment has puzzled biologists since the time of Darwin. More recently, several different adaptive hypotheses have been proposed to explain eye degeneration based on studies in the teleost Astyanax mexicanus, which consists of blind cave-dwelling (cavefish) and sighted surface-dwelling (surface fish) forms. One of these hypotheses is that eye regression is the result of indirect selection for constructive characters that are negatively linked to eye development through the pleiotropic effects of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling. However, subsequent genetic analyses suggested that other mechanisms also contribute to eye regression in Astyanax cavefish. Here, we introduce a new approach to this problem by investigating the phenotypic and genetic relationships between a suite of non-visual constructive traits and eye regression.   Results: Using quantitative genetic analysis of crosses between surface fish, the Pachon cavefish population and their hybrid progeny, we show that the adaptive vibration attraction behavior (VAB) and its sensory receptors, superficial neuromasts (SN) specifically found within the cavefish eye orbit (EO), are genetically correlated with reduced eye size. The quantitative trait loci (QTL) for these three traits form two clusters of congruent or overlapping QTL on Astyanax linkage groups (LG) 2 and 17, but not at the shh locus on LG 13. Ablation of EO SN in cavefish demonstrated a major role for these sensory receptors in VAB expression. Furthermore, experimental induction of eye regression in surface fish via shh overexpression showed that the absence of eyes was insufficient to promote the appearance of VAB or EO SN.   Conclusions: We conclude that natural selection for the enhancement of VAB and EO SN indirectly promotes eye regression in the Pachon cavefish population through an antagonistic relationship involving genetic linkage or pleiotropy among the genetic factors underlying these traits.

Such 'animal personality' variation is intriguing because behavioural flexibility is often assumed to be the norm. Recent theory predicts that between-individual differences in propensity to take risks should evolve if individuals differ in future fitness expectations: individuals with high long-term fitness expectations (i.e. that have much to lose) should behave consistently more cautious than individuals with lower expectations. Consequently, any manipulation of future fitness expectations should result in within-individual changes in risky behaviour in the direction predicted by this adaptive theory. We tested this prediction and confirmed experimentally that individuals indeed adjust their 'exploration behaviour', a proxy for risk-taking behaviour, to their future fitness expectations. We show for wild great tits (Parus major) that individuals with experimentally decreased survival probability become faster explorers (i.e. increase risk-taking behaviour) compared to individuals with increased survival probability. We also show, using quantitative genetics approaches, that non-genetic effects (i.e. permanent environment effects) underpin adaptive personality variation in this species. This study thereby confirms a key prediction of adaptive personality theory based on life-history trade-offs, and implies that selection may indeed favour the evolution of personalities in situations where individuals differ in future fitness expectations.",individuals adjust their risk taking behavior to their future fitness expectations by experimentallyl decreasing survival probability.

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, aggregation is regulated by environmental context and by two neuromodulatory pathways, one dependent on the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1 and one dependent on the TGF-beta family protein DAF-7. To gain further insight into the genetic regulation of aggregation, we characterize natural variation underlying behavioral differences between two wild-type C. elegans strains, N2 and CB4856. Using quantitative genetic techniques, including a survey of chromosome substitution strains and QTL analysis of recombinant inbred lines, we identify three new QTLs affecting aggregation in addition to the two known N2 mutations in npr-1 and glb-5. Fine-mapping with near-isogenic lines localized one QTL, accounting for 5%-8% of the behavioral variance between N2 and CB4856, 3' to the transcript of the GABA neurotransmitter receptor gene exp-1. Quantitative complementation tests demonstrated that this QTL affects exp-1, identifying exp-1 and GABA signaling as new regulators of aggregation. exp-1 interacts genetically with the daf-7 TGF-beta pathway, which integrates food availability and population density, and exp-1 mutations affect the level of daf-7 expression.

In addition, testosterone is associated with behavioural traits, including sexual behaviour and social dominance. The level of circulating testosterone in the human body is determined by genetic and environmental factors. Twin studies have shown moderate to high heritability in adolescence and adulthood, but heritability in early childhood has not been investigated. This study aimed at disentangling the genetic and environmental contributions to testosterone levels soon after birth.   Methods: Using a sample of 314 twin pairs, saliva testosterone levels were measured at 5 months after birth. Quantitative genetic modelling was used to assess genetic and environmental contributions to the variation in testosterone levels.   Results: Variation in testosterone levels was explained by common (56.6%) and unique (43.4%) environmental factors.   Conclusions: Taken together, these data from the largest study of twin testosterone levels suggest that, in contrast to findings in adulthood, environmental factors determine the interindividual variability in testosterone levels in early infancy. This may have consequences for the development of sex-related behaviour during childhood and calls for studies designed to unravel specific genetic and environmental factors involved in this process.

Understanding the evolutionary dynamics of a behavioral syndrome requires knowledge of its genetic underpinning. At present, our understanding of the genetic basis of behavioral syndromes is largely restricted to domestic and laboratory animals. Wild behavioral syndromes are mostly inferred on the basis of phenotypic correlations, and thus make the ""phenotypic gambit"" of assuming that these phenotypic correlations capture the underlying genetic correlations. On the basis of 3 years of reciprocal cross-fostering of 2896 nestlings of 271 families within a pedigreed population, we show that the nestling personality traits handling aggression, breathing rate, and docility are heritable (h(2) = 16-29%), and often have a pronounced ""nest-of-rearing"" variance component (10-15%), but a relatively small ""nest-of-origin"" variance component (0-7%). The three nestling personality traits form a behavioral syndrome on the phenotypic and genetic level. Overall, the phenotypic correlations provide a satisfactory description of the genetic ones, but significantly underestimate the magnitude of one of the pairwise genetic correlations, which mirrors the conclusion based on domestic and laboratory studies.","personality traits are heritable and have a pronounced nest-of-rearing variane component but small nest-of-origin variance. the phenotypic correlations provide a satisfactory description of the genetic ones, but significantly underestimate the magnitude of one of the pairwise genetic correlations",Cyanistes caeruleus ,blue tits,Aves,3 years reciprocal cross-fostering within a pedigreed population,"cross-foster, pedigree",useful example,skim,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,not human

For many animals, part of the environment is social and provided by parents and other interacting partners. When expression of genes in social partners affects trait expression in a focal individual, indirect genetic effects occur. In this study, we explore the effects of indirect genetic effects on the magnitude and range of phenotypic values in a focal individual in a multi-member model analyzing three possible classes of interactions between individuals. We show that social interactions may not only cause indirect genetic effects but can also modify direct genetic effects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both direct and indirect genetic effects substantially alter the range of phenotypic values, particularly when a focal trait can influence its own expression via interactions with traits in other individuals. We derive a function predicting the relative importance of direct versus indirect genetic effects. Our model reveals that both direct and indirect genetic effects can depend to a large extent on both group size and interaction strength, altering group mean phenotype and variance. This may lead to scenarios where between group variation is much higher than within group variation despite similar underlying genetic properties, potentially affecting the level of selection. Our analysis highlights key properties of indirect genetic effects with important consequences for trait evolution, the level of selection and potentially speciation.","part of the environment can be a social environment => IGE. social interactions may not only cause indirect genetic effects but can also modify direct genetic effects, and both direct and indiret genetic effects substantially alter the range of phenotypic values.

We describe a new method, 2D annotation enrichment, which compares quantitative data from any two 'omics' types in the context of categorical annotation of the proteins or genes. Suitable genome-wide categories are membership of proteins in biochemical pathways, their annotation with gene ontology terms, sub-cellular localization, the presence of protein domains or membership in protein complexes. 2D annotation enrichment detects annotation terms whose members show consistent behavior in one or both of the data dimensions. This consistent behavior can be a correlation between the two data types, such as simultaneous up-or down-regulation in both data dimensions, or a lack thereof, such as regulation in one dimension but no change in the other. For the statistical formulation of the test we introduce a two-dimensional generalization of the nonparametric two-sample test. The false discovery rate is stringently controlled by correcting for multiple hypothesis testing. We also describe one-dimensional annotation enrichment, which can be applied to single omics data.

Contrary to a common belief tested animals entered water rather easily, often even engaging in repeated swimming. We found significant differences in scored behavioural parameters between the subspecies. Under the 20 degrees C regime, both wild and inbred domesticus males entered and crossed the water earlier and more often swam even when satiated. Strikingly, under the 10 degrees C regime, the results were rather equivocal but with the opposite tendencies, with musculus males being more willing to swim.

I show how Schmalhausen's ideas are relevant to the results of a century-long corn-breeding experiment and the current concepts of facilitated variation and cryptic genetic variation.

However, consistent individual differences in behaviour (personality), such as in risk-taking, might affect an individual's ability to find food, avoid predators and adjust to new conditions. It is now well known that personalities exist in many taxa, but much less is known about individual variation in plasticity. We measured the tendency to begin foraging across different levels of risk in house sparrows (Passer domesticus), using a behavioural reaction norm framework to simultaneously assess personality and plasticity. We asked whether individuals were consistently different across risk levels, and whether they differed in habituation and neophobia, both of which were treated as cases of plasticity. We found that males habituated more than females by beginning to feed sooner after repeated instances of a human disturbance in the presence of an initially unfamiliar object. Individuals of both sexes also exhibited consistent differences across trials, but did not differ in the rate of habituation beyond the difference between the sexes. When a novel object was placed in the foraging area, both sexes exhibited similar degrees of neophobia by delaying feeding. The magnitude of this change varied among birds, indicating individual differences in neophobia. Our results indicate that both personality and individual variation in plasticity exist but should be treated as independent phenomena. The presence of variation in plasticity implies that the raw material necessary for selection on neophobia exists, and that if heritable, plasticity in risk-taking across contexts could evolve.",looked at phenotypic correlations,Passer domesticus,house sparrows,Aves,measured tendency to begin foraging using behavioral reaction norm framework.,phenotypes,both personality and individual variation in plasticity exist but should be treated as independent phenomena,no,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,not human

While rare and especially de novo genetic variation are known to affect liability, whether common genetic polymorphism plays a substantial role is an open question and the relative contribution of genes and environment is contentious. It is probable that the relative contributions of rare and common variation, as well as environment, differs between ASD families having only a single affected individual (simplex) versus multiplex families who have two or more affected individuals.   Methods: By using quantitative genetics techniques and the contrast of ASD subjects to controls, we estimate what portion of liability can be explained by additive genetic effects, known as narrow-sense heritability. We evaluate relatives of ASD subjects using the same methods to evaluate the assumptions of the additive model and partition families by simplex/multiplex status to determine how heritability changes with status.   Results: By analyzing common variation throughout the genome, we show that common genetic polymorphism exerts substantial additive genetic effects on ASD liability and that simplex/multiplex family status has an impact on the identified composition of that risk. As a fraction of the total variation in liability, the estimated narrow-sense heritability exceeds 60% for ASD individuals from multiplex families and is approximately 40% for simplex families. By analyzing parents, unaffected siblings and alleles not transmitted from parents to their affected children, we conclude that the data for simplex ASD families follow the expectation for additive models closely. The data from multiplex families deviate somewhat from an additive model, possibly due to parental assortative mating.   Conclusions: Our results, when viewed in the context of results from genome-wide association studies, demonstrate that a myriad of common variants of very small effect impacts ASD liability.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

The additive genetic cross-trait correlations between the segments ranged between 0.43 and 0.75, suggesting a shared genetic influence on the three carotid segments. Additive inherited effects contributed 21% and 31% (common and internal carotid, respectively) to the total variance of the intima-media thickness, while measured cardiovascular risk factors accounted for 46% and 26% (common and internal carotid, respectively).

A conceptual framework has recently been developed for understanding life-history evolution and diversification in these animals, and it has confirmed that each of two linked life-history traits - the mode of larval development and the temporal pattern of egg maturation - acts as an organiser of life-history. The framework has been predicated on the assumption that there exists sufficient genetic variation in the latter trait to allow it to be shaped by natural selection. Focusing on the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma brassicae, our aim was to test the validity of that assumption, using established quantitative genetic methods. We demonstrate the existence of a statistically significant degree of intra-population polygenic variation in the temporal pattern of egg production within the wasp population we studied. Furthermore, our results, together with published data on clinal variation in the egg maturation pattern of another species, suggest that intra-specific evolutionary shifts in the temporal pattern of egg maturation of parasitoid wasps can result from a change in allocation to egg production either before, or very shortly after adult emergence, without there being an accompanying change in lifetime fecundity. As well as opening new avenues of research into the reproductive strategies, behaviour, community organisation and biological control potential of parasitoid wasps, this discovery also has implications for studies of life-history evolution and diversification in insects generally.",not behavior,Trichogramma brassicaae,parasitoid wasp,Insecta,established quantitative genetic methods,,egg maturation patterns,no,,,x,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,not human

Indirect approaches have recently revealed reproductive isolation resulting from flowering time (so-called isolation by time, IBT). Since phenological processes can be subject to selection, the persistence of flowering asynchrony may be due to opposing selective pressures during mating, dispersal, and regeneration phases. Our study aimed to investigate phenology, fruit handling by animals, and their interaction in a timber tree species, Milicia excelsa.   Methods: We analyzed phenological data collected over 6 years on 69 genotyped trees in a Cameroonian natural rainforest complemented by data from germination trials and field observations of dispersers.   Key results: Initiation of flowering was correlated with variation in temperature and relative humidity, but was also affected by genetic factors: pairwise differences in flowering time between nearby individuals correlated with kinship coefficient, and earliness of flowering remained stable over time. A decrease in mean seed production per fruit with increasing flowering time suggests selection against late bloomers. However, germination rate was not affected by seed collection date, and the main seed disperser, the bat Eidolon helvum, seemed to increase in abundance at the end of the reproductive season and preferred trees in open habitats where early and late bloomers are expected.   Conclusions: The pairwise approach performs well in detecting IBT. The persistence of different mating pools in such a case may result from a trade off between selective forces during the mating and seed dispersal processes.",plants,,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Univariate behavioral genetic analyses have consistently found the influence of additive genes and nonshared environment on multiple personality facets, but the extent to which genetic and environmental influences on specific facets reflect more general influences on higher order factors is less clear. We applied a multivariate quantitative-genetic approach to scores on the CPI-Big Five facets for 490 monozygotic and 317 dizygotic twins who took part in the National Merit Twin Study. Our results revealed a complex genetic structure for facets composing all five factors, with both domain-general and facet-specific genetic and environmental influences. For three of the Big Five domains, models that required common genetic and environmental influences on each facet to occur by way of effects on a higher order trait did not fit as well as models allowing for common genetic and environmental effects to act directly on the facets.

Associated indirect genetic effects (IGEs) can affect the rate and direction of evolutionary change, but sexual selection models do not capture these dynamics. We incorporate IGEs into quantitative genetic models to explore how variation in social environments and mate choice flexibility influence Fisherian sexual selection. The importance of IGEs is that runaway sexual selection can occur in the absence of a genetic correlation between male traits and female preferences. Social influences can facilitate the initiation of the runaway process and increase the rate of trait elaboration. Incorporating costs to choice do not alter the main findings. Our model provides testable predictions: (1) genetic covariances between male traits and female preferences may not exist, (2) social flexibility in female choice will be common in populations experiencing strong sexual selection, (3) variation in social environments should be associated with rapid sexual trait divergence, and (4) secondary sexual traits will be more elaborate than previously predicted. Allowing feedback from the social environment resolves discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical data, such as why indirect selection on female preferences, theoretically weak, might be sufficient for preferences to become elaborated.",incorporate IGEs into quantitative genetic models to explore how variation in social environments and mate choice flexibility influence Fisherian sexual selection,,,,mathematical model,,excellent theoreticcal model with testable predictions,yes,,x,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,x,,not human

Such phenomenon is labelled as behavioural syndrome and is usually demonstrated by phenotypic correlations between behaviours like activity, exploration, aggression and risk-taking across individuals in a population. However, published studies disagree on the strength, and even on the existence of such relationships. To make general inferences from this mixed evidence, we quantitatively reviewed the literature using modern meta-analytic approaches. Based on a large dataset, we investigated the overall relationship between behaviours that are expected to form a syndrome and tested which factors can mediate heterogeneities in study outcomes. The average strength of the phenotypic correlation between behaviours was weak; we found no effect of the phylogeny of species but did observe significant publication bias. However, even accounting for this bias, the mean effect size was positive and statistically different from zero (r = 0.198). Effect sizes showed considerable heterogeneity within species, implying a role for population-specific adaptation to environmental factors and/or between-study differences in research design. There was a significant positive association between absolute effect size and repeatability of behaviours, suggesting that within-individual variation of behavioural traits can set up an upper limit for the strength of the detected phenotypic correlations. Moreover, spatial overlap between the contexts in which different behaviours were assayed increased the magnitude of the association. The small effect size for the focal relationship implies that a huge sample size would be required to demonstrate a correlation between behaviours with sufficient statistical power, which is fulfilled only in very few studies. This suggests that behavioural syndromes often remain undetected and unpublished. Collectively, our meta-analysis revealed a number of points that might be worth to consider in the future study of behavioural syndromes.",phenotypic correlations between behaviors create behavioral syndromes.  but how often do they occur and how strong are the relationships,,,,meta analysis,,average strength of phenotypic correlationi between behaviors was weak but mean effect size was positive and different from zero.

In particular, locomotor trade-offs between endurance or maximal exertion capacity and burst performance capacity have been observed in some species and may constrain the ability of organisms to disperse. Here, we tested for the presence of locomotor trade-offs between maximal exertion and burst performance capacity in an aquatic frog, the tropical clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis). Given the importance of overland dispersal for this species, we focused on terrestrial exertion capacity (time and distance jumped until exhaustion) and tested whether it trades-off with aquatic burst performance capacity (maximum instantaneous velocity and acceleration), which is likely to be relevant in the context of predator escape and prey capture. Our data show that in both sexes, individuals with longer hindlimbs display higher endurance. Additionally, in females forelimb length was positively correlated with aquatic burst performance capacity and negatively correlated with terrestrial exertion. Trade-offs between endurance and burst performance capacity were detected, but were significant in males only. Finally, males and females differ in morphology and performance. Our data suggest that trade-offs are not universal and may be driven by sex-dependent selection on locomotor capacity. Moreover, our results suggest that locomotor trade-offs may result in sex-biased dispersal under selection for improved endurance capacity as is expected under habitat fragmentation scenarios.",tradeoffs between terrestrial and aquatic locomotion.

The present study examines genetic and environmental influences on the association between pubertal maturation and internalizing problems for boys and girls in two primarily Caucasian adolescent twin/sibling studies: The Swedish Twin study of CHild and Adolescent Development (706 same-sex twin pairs aged 13-14, M = 13.7 years, 50 % female), and the Nonshared Environment in Adolescent Development sample (US-based, 687 same-sex twin/sibling pairs aged 10-18, M = 13.6 years, 47 % female). For girls, more advanced pubertal maturation was associated modestly with more internalizing problems, and that association was entirely explained by shared environmental influences. For boys, the association between pubertal maturation and internalizing problems was weak and inconsistent. Results for girls were remarkably consistent across samples.

Understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits is a long-term task for quantitative geneticists and plant breeders who wish to design efficient breeding programs. Conventionally, the genetic properties of traits can be revealed by partitioning the total variation into variation components caused by specific genetic effects. With recent advances in molecular genotyping and high-throughput technology, the unraveling of the genetic architecture of complex traits by analyzing quantitative trait locus (QTL) has become possible. The improvement of complex traits has also been achieved by pyramiding individual QTL.

It consists of five domains for handling data from diallel crosses, regional trials, core germplasm collections, QTL mapping, and microarray experiments. The first domain contains genetic models for diallel cross analysis, in which genetic variance components and genetic-by-environment interactions can be estimated, and genetic effects can be predicted. The second domain evaluates the performance of varieties in regional trials by implementing a general statistical method that outperforms ANOVA in tackling unbalanced data that arises frequently in trials across multiple locations and over a number of years. The third domain, using predicted genotypic values as proxy, constructs core germplasm collections covering sufficient genetic diversity with lower redundancy. The fourth domain manages genotypic and phenotypic data for QTL mapping. Linkage maps can be constructed and genetic distances can be estimated; the statistical methods that have been implemented apply to both chiasmatic and achiasmatic organisms. Another part of this domain can filter systematic noises in phenotypic data. The fifth domain focuses on the cDNA expression data that is generated by microarray experiments. A two-step strategy has been implemented to detect differentially expressed genes and to estimate their effects. Except in the fourth domain, the major statistical methods that have been used are mixed linear model approaches that have been implemented in the C language. Computational efficiency is further boosted for computers that are equipped with graphics processing units (GPUs).

Such traits whose expression in an individual is partly determined by the phenotype of its social partner are called interacting phenotypes. Quantitative genetic models suggested that interacting phenotypes can evolve much faster than nonsocial traits. Current models, however, consider the interaction between phenotypes of social partners as a fixed phenotypic response rule, represented by an interaction coefficient (?). Here, we extend existing theoretical models and incorporate the interaction coefficient as a trait that can evolve. We find that the evolution of the interaction coefficient can change qualitatively the predictions about the rate and direction of evolution of interacting phenotypes. We argue that it is crucial to determine whether and how the phenotypic response of an individual to its social partner can evolve to make accurate predictions about the evolution of traits involved in social interactions.",theoretical model of interacting phenotypes (where expression of a trait is partly determined by trait of social partner) to incorporate interaction coefficient as an evolving trait.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate genetic and environmental influences on different aspects of physical activity in young adult twins. Methods: We studied 1274 Finnish twins with a mean age of 22.4 yr, from the population-based FinnTwin12 study. Physical activity was assessed with the Baecke Questionnaire, yielding four indexes: the sport index, leisure time activity index, work index, and total score. Quantitative genetic analyses based on linear structural equations were used to estimate the contribution of genetic and environmental factors on these physical activity traits. Results: The overall heritability estimates were 64% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.56%-0.70%) for sports activity, 41% (95% CI = 0.31%-0.51%) for leisure time activity excluding sports, 56% (95% CI = 0.48%-0.63%) for physical activity at work, and 54% (95% CI = 0.45%-0.62%) for total physical activity. Unique environmental factors accounted for the rest of the trait variances. We did not find evidence for common environmental or dominant genetic influences. The heritability estimates did not differ between men and women, and no sex-specific genetic factors were found. Sports activity and leisure time activity excluding sports were associated (r = 0.27), and additive genetic factors explained 57% of their association. Conclusions: Our results suggest that genetic factors contribute significantly to physical activity levels in young adults and that sports activity is under stronger genetic influence than leisure time physical activity excluding sports. We also concluded that physical activity at work does not seem to be associated with sports activities or other leisure time physical activity at this age.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

L.", The effects of migration and drift on local adaptation to a   heterogeneous environment,25,2012," Local adaptation experiments are widely used to quantify the levels of adaptation within a heterogeneous environment. However, theoretical studies generally focus on the probability of fixation of alleles or the mean fitness of populations, rather than local adaptation as it is commonly measured experimentally or in field studies. Here, we develop mathematical models and use them to generate analytical predictions for the level of local adaptation as a function of selection, migration and genetic drift. First, we contrast mean fitness and local adaptation measures and show that the latter can be expressed in a simple and general way as a function of the spatial covariance between population mean phenotype and local environmental conditions. Second, we develop several approximations of a population genetics model to show that the system exhibits different behaviours depending on the rate of migration. The main insights are the following: with intermediate migration, both genetic drift and migration decrease local adaptation; with low migration, drift decreases local adaptation but migration speeds up adaptation; with high migration, genetic drift has no effect on local adaptation. Third, we extend this analysis to cases where the trait under selection is continuous using classical quantitative genetics theory. Finally, we discuss these results in the light of recent experimental work on local adaptation.",not behavior,,,,mathematical models,,a general pop gen analysis that gets extended to quantitative genetics,later,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Due to the high degree of polymorphism in behavioral, growth and life-history traits, both farmed and wild salmonids are highly susceptible to microenvironmental variation, yet the heritable basis of this characteristic remains unknown. We estimated the genetic (co)variance of body weight and its residual variation in 2-year-old rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using a multigenerational data of 45,900 individuals from the Finnish national breeding programme. We also tested whether or not microenvironmental sensitivity has been changed as a correlated genetic response when genetic improvement for growth has been practiced over five generations. The animal model analysis revealed the presence of genetic heterogeneity both in body weight and its residual variation. Heritability of residual variation was remarkably lower (0.02) than that for body weight (0.35). However, genetic coefficient of variation was notable in both body weight (14%) and its residual variation (37%), suggesting a substantial potential for selection responses in both traits. Furthermore, a significant negative genetic correlation (-0.16) was found between body weight and its residual variation, i.e., rapidly growing genotypes are also more tolerant to perturbations in microenvironment. The genetic trends showed that fish growth was successfully increased by selective breeding (an average of 6% per generation), whereas no genetic change occurred in residual variation during the same period. The results imply that genetic improvement for body weight does not cause a concomitant increase in microenvironmental sensitivity. For commercial production, however, there may be high potential to simultaneously improve weight gain and increase its uniformity if both criteria are included in a selection index.",not behavior,Oncorhynchus mykiss,rainbow trout,Actinopterygii,animal model analysis,,focused on fish growth and body weight,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Most of this attention has been on universal aspects of mate preferences, but variation between individuals is less understood. In particular, the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences to variation in mate preferences is key to sexual selection models but has barely been investigated in humans, and results have been mixed in other species. Here, we used data from over 4000 mostly female twins who ranked the importance of 13 key traits in a potential partner. We used the classical twin design to partition variation in these preferences into that due to genes, family environment, and residual factors. In women, there was significant variability in the broad-sense heritability of individual trait preferences, with physical attractiveness the most heritable (29%) and housekeeping ability the least (5%). Over all the trait preferences combined, broad-sense heritabilities were highly significant in women and marginally significant in men, accounting for 20% and 19% of the variation, respectively; family environmental influences were much smaller.

Murray, Dennis L.", Evidence for a genetic basis for delayed dispersal in a cooperatively   breeding canid,83,2012," Among cooperatively breeding species, delayed dispersal provides an opportunity for older siblings to help rear young. There is considerable variation in the extent to which cooperative breeders delay dispersal, however, and while delayed dispersal may be a consequence of adaptive evolution favouring family living, evidence for a genetic basis is lacking. Furthermore, the extent to which dispersal behaviour itself is under direct selection, or evolves indirectly in response to selection on correlated life-history traits, remains unclear. We tested for evidence of inter-and intraspecific quantitative genetic variation in age at first dispersal in a reintroduced population of the red wolf, Canis rufus, that naturally hybridizes with the coyote, Canis latrans, which delays dispersal to a lesser extent than the red wolf. Using analyses based on individual relationships to population founders and sire-offspring regressions, we found evidence for intraspecific genetic variation in dispersal age in male, but not female, red wolves. We also found evidence for interspecific genetic variation, in that red wolves had later dispersal age than coyote-red wolf hybrids. Intraspecific variation in dispersal age was not explained by variation in social and environmental factors nor alternative targets of selection such as body mass or age at first reproduction. Thus, selection may act directly on dispersal-related behaviours. However, life-history traits may continue to be influential in creating interspecific differences in dispersal age, as hybrids also showed earlier reproduction. Our findings suggest that evolution of delayed dispersal may be due to both direct and indirect selection on existing quantitative genetic variation, and that genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying dispersal may differ between the sexes.

This finding strongly supports that genetic factors are significant determinants of osteoporosis risk along with individual biological and behavioral factors.   Although genetic factors are known to contribute significantly to variations in BMD in Western populations, such an association has not been fully evaluated in an Asian population. This study was conducted to determine the role of genetic factors on BMD in Korean population.

BMD was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Quantitative genetic analysis based on a variance decomposition model was performed.   Age and the measured covariates accounted for 17 similar to 61% of the variation in BMD, depending on the sites of measurement. After accounting for the covariate effects, the heritability of BMD at the whole body, thoracic and lumbar spine, whole ribs, whole pelvis, whole arms, and whole legs were 0.76, 0.72, 0.73, 0.71, 0.51, and 0.75, respectively. The pair-wise correlation of BMD was the highest within MZ twin pairs, followed by DZ twin pairs, sibling pairs, and parents-child pairs. Cross-trait correlation analysis revealed a positive genetic correlation between BMDs at different sites, ranging from 0.80 (arm and leg BMD) to 0.50 (pelvis and arm BMD).

Jhwueng, Dwueng-Chwuan", Coevolution in multidimensional trait space favours escape from   parasites and pathogens,483,2012," Almost all species are subject to continuous attack by parasites and pathogens. Because parasites and pathogens tend to have shorter generation times(1,2) and often experience stronger selection due to interaction than their victims do(3,4), it is frequently argued that they should evolve more rapidly and thus maintain an advantage in the evolutionary race between defence and counter-defence(1,5). This prediction generates an apparent paradox: how do victim species survive and even thrive in the face of a continuous onslaught of more rapidly evolving enemies(5)? One potential explanation is that defence is physiologically, mechanically or behaviourally easier than attack, so that evolution is less constrained for victims than for parasites or pathogens(6). Another possible explanation is that parasites and pathogens have enemies themselves and that victim species persist because parasites and pathogens are regulated from the top down and thus generally have only modest demographic impacts on victimpopulations(7,8). Here we explore a third possibility: that victim species are not as evolutionarily impotent as conventional wisdom holds, but instead have unique evolutionary advantages that help to level the playing field. We use quantitative genetic analysis and individual-based simulations to show that victims can achieve such an advantage when coevolution involves multiple traits in both the host and the parasite.",coevolution of host-pathogen interactions in which the victim has advantages to help level the playing field.

 J, EVOLUTION," Westneat, DFAF Westneat, David F.", EVOLUTION IN RESPONSE TO SOCIAL SELECTION: THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERACTIVE   EFFECTS OF TRAITS ON FITNESS,66,2012," Social interactions have a powerful effect on the evolutionary process. Recent attempts to synthesize models of social selection with equations for indirect genetic effects (McGlothlin et al. 2010) provide a broad theoretical base from which to study selection and evolutionary response in the context of social interactions. However, this framework concludes that social selection will lead to evolution only if the traits carried by social partners are nonrandomly associated. I suggest this conclusion is incomplete, and that traits that do not covary between social partners can nevertheless lead to evolution via interactive effects on fitness. Such effects occur when there are functional interactions between traits, and as an example I use the interplay in water striders (Gerridae) between grasping appendages carried by males and spines by females. Functional interactive effects between traits can be incorporated into both the equations for social selection and the general model of social evolution proposed by McGlothlin et al. These expanded equations would accommodate adaptive coevolution in social interactions, integrate the quantitative genetic approach to social evolution with game theoretical approaches, and stimulate some new questions about the process of social evolution.",verbal model with example to extend social selection + IGEs to include traits that do not covary beetween social partners when there are functional interactions between traits,Gerris lacustris,water striders,Insecta,review/verbal model,,I'm curious about this and it's probably a good point on IGEs and behavior,yes,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,x,,not human

Plomin, Robert   Fisher, Abigail   Wardle, Jane", Inherited behavioral susceptibility to adiposity in infancy: a   multivariate genetic analysis of appetite and weight in the Gemini birth   cohort,95,2012," Background: The behavioral susceptibility model proposes that inherited differences in traits such as appetite confer differential risk of weight gain and contribute to the heritability of weight. Evidence that the FTO gene may influence weight partly through its effects on appetite supports this model, but testing the behavioral pathways for multiple genes with very small effects is not feasible. Twin analyses make it possible to get a broad-based estimate of the extent of shared genetic influence between appetite and weight.   Objective: The objective was to use multivariate twin analyses to test the hypothesis that associations between appetite and weight are underpinned by shared genetic effects.   Design: Data were from Gemini, a population-based birth cohort of twins (n = 4804) born in 2007. Infant weights at 3 mo were taken from the records of health professionals. Appetite was assessed at 3 mo for the milk-feeding period by using the Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (BEBQ), a parent-reported measure of appetite [enjoyment of food, food responsiveness, slowness in eating (SE), satiety responsiveness (SR), and appetite size (AS)]. Multivariate quantitative genetic modeling was used to test for shared genetic influences.   Results: Significant correlations were found between all BEBQ traits and weight. Significant shared genetic influence was identified for weight with SE, SR, and AS; genetic correlations were between 0.22 and 0.37. Shared genetic effects explained 41-45% of these phenotypic associations.   Conclusion: Differences in weight in infancy may be due partly to genetically determined differences in appetitive traits that confer differential susceptibility to obesogenic environments.

 J, GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY," Caro, SPAF Caro, Samuel P.", Avian ecologists and physiologists have different sexual preferences,176,2012," Seasonal timing is studied by ecologists and physiologists alike and it is now widely recognized that further integration of these fields is needed for a full understanding of phenology. This is especially true in the light of the impact of global climate change on living organisms. In studies of avian reproduction, one obstacle to this integration is that ecologists and physiologists do not allocate their research efforts equally to males and females. The physiological orchestration of breeding stages has been studied almost exclusively in males, while in avian ecology and evolutionary biology females are more often considered. This sex bias has severe implications: sexes differ in the way they use external cues to organize their life cycles, but often cue in on each other's physiology and behavior. The simultaneous investigation of both males and females within single studies is thus essential. In this review, I begin by illustrating the sex-bias in studies and attempt to explain its origin. I then provide a number of examples in which focusing on a single sex would have resulted in misleading conclusions. Finally, I review some classical studies of female reproductive physiology that have promoted and developed research on the ""forgotten-sex"". (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This often involves the evolution of specialized patterns of host acceptance that in turn lead to assortative mating for insects that mate exclusively on their hosts. Here, we explore the genetic architecture of feeding behavior in a herbivorous insect that has become a model for the study of incipient speciation, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum). We use crosses between individuals specialized to either alfalfa or red clover in order to perform both a biometrical analysis and a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of key feeding behaviors. For each character in each environment, Castle-Wright's estimator for the number of effective factors segregating ranged from 0.11 to 2.54. Similarly, between 0 and 3 QTLs were detected. In one case, a single QTL explained over 50% of the variance in the F2, suggesting that at least one gene (or a complex of tightly linked genes) has a major effect on feeding behavior in the pea aphid. However, the identified OIL explain only 23-73% of the genetic variance for these characters thus additional genes of minor effect are also involved. We found a variety of modes of gene action, including several cases of non-additive gene action. Our results suggest that feeding behavior in pea aphids is neither simple nor highly polygenic. The oligogenetic basis of variation in feeding behavior may facilitate host shifts, providing one explanation for the frequent divergence and speciation of herbivorous insects.

Our ability to understand the evolutionary trajectories of personality traits requires insights from the quantitative genetics of behavioural reaction norms. We assayed > 1000 pedigreed stickleback for initial exploration behaviour of a novel environment, and subsequent changes in exploration over a few hours, representing their capacity to adjust their behaviour to changes in perceived novelty and risk. We found heritable variation in both the average level of exploration and behavioural plasticity, and population differences in the sign of the genetic correlation between these two reaction norm components. The phenotypic correlation was not a good indicator of the genetic correlation, implying that quantitative genetics are necessary to appropriately evaluate evolutionary hypotheses in cases such as these. Our findings therefore have important implications for future studies concerning the evolution of personality and plasticity.","heritable variation in average level of exploration and behavioral plasticity, and population differences in the sign of genetic correlation",Gasterosteus aculeatus,three-spined stickleback,Actinopterygii,pedigree,pedigree,example of population level differences.

The successful introduction and invasive potential of a species are related to its levels of phenotypic plasticity and genetic polymorphism. We analysed changes in the body mass and length of American mink (Neovison vison) since its introduction into the Warta Mouth National Park, western Poland, in relation to diet composition and colonization progress from 1996 to 2004. Mink body mass decreased significantly during the period of population establishment within the study area, with an average decrease of 13% from 1.36 to 1.18 kg in males and of 16% from 0.83 to 0.70 kg in females. Diet composition varied seasonally and between consecutive years. The main prey items were mammals and fish in the cold season and birds and fish in the warm season. During the study period the proportion of mammals preyed upon increased in the cold season and decreased in the warm season. The proportion of birds preyed upon decreased over the study period, whereas the proportion of fish increased. Following introduction, the strictly aquatic portion of mink diet (fish and frogs) increased over time, whereas the proportion of large prey (large birds, muskrats, and water voles) decreased. The average yearly proportion of large prey and average-sized prey in the mink diet was significantly correlated with the mean body masses of males and females. Biogeographical variation in the body mass and length of mink was best explained by the percentage of large prey in the mink diet in both sexes, and by latitude for females. Together these results demonstrate that American mink rapidly changed their body mass in relation to local conditions. This phenotypic variability may be underpinned by phenotypic plasticity and/or by adaptation of quantitative genetic variation. The potential to rapidly change phenotypic variation in this manner is an important factor determining the negative ecological impacts of invasive species.

L.", Relative LWS cone opsin expression determines optomotor thresholds in   Malawi cichlid fish,11,2012," Associating quantitative genetic traits with quantitative behaviors is a relatively unexplored region of sensory neurobiology. The visual system is an ideal place to test models associating these levels of sensory perception. In this study, we reared cichlid fish from Lake Malawi in different ambient light environments. We then tested the visual sensitivities of these fish using the optomotor response (OMR) behavioral paradigm and measured the relative expression of cone opsin genes. We found that the light environment experienced by fish during development can alter gene expression, particularly as it applies to the long wavelength-sensitive (LWS) opsin gene. Also, fish from different rearing conditions exhibited different behavioral sensitivities. We combined these data with predictions of opsin pigment absorption by the different OMR stimuli to determine which cone types are most likely to influence the OMR behavior. While we hypothesized that this behavior would be controlled by a random-wiring model reflecting the expression of both medium wavelength-sensitive (MWS) and LWS opsins, our models suggest that only the LWS pigment is required to predict behavior. Furthermore, analyses show that LWS expression variation accounts for similar to 20% of the observed behavioral variance. This work confirms that sensory gene expression influences behavior in a predictable fashion. It also suggests that the neural wiring of basal visual pathways in cichlid fish may differ from that observed in mammals and zebrafish, but is similar to that described in goldfish.

A single ASTRINGENCY (AST) locus controls the astringency/non-astringency (A/NA) trait of persimmon fruit, one of the most important traits for consumption, on each of the six corresponding chromosomes. Although several molecular approaches are in progress to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of astringency trait in persimmon, the distinct polysomic behavior of the AST locus remains to be solved. The aim of this study was to perform fine genotyping of a highly polymorphic marker locus linked to the AST locus, detect the allele pairing in ten segregated F(1) lines derived from hybridization of A-type x NA-type cultivars, and identify the basis of hexaploid inheritance at the AST locus in persimmon. The results showed that persimmon cultivars frequently produce aneuploid offspring bearing an extra chromosome with the AST locus, with the incidence of aneuploidy varying among the cultivars. On the examination of hexasomic behavior in persimmon cultivars, the ratios of individuals bearing each allele pair segregated from A-type parents showed a good fit to the expected ratios in an autohexaploid inheritance model, except for cvs. Luo-tian-tian-shi and Sa-gok-shi which fitted to an autoallohexaploid inheritance model.

 J, AMERICAN NATURALIST," Akcay, E   Van Cleve, JAF Akcay, Erol   Van Cleve, Jeremy", Behavioral Responses in Structured Populations Pave the Way to Group   Optimality,179,2012," An unresolved controversy regarding social behaviors is exemplified when natural selection might lead to behaviors that maximize fitness at the social-group level but are costly at the individual level. Except for the special case of groups of clones, we do not have a general understanding of how and when group-optimal behaviors evolve, especially when the behaviors in question are flexible. To address this question, we develop a general model that integrates behavioral plasticity in social interactions with the action of natural selection in structured populations. We find that group-optimal behaviors can evolve, even without clonal groups, if individuals exhibit appropriate behavioral responses to each other's actions. The evolution of such behavioral responses, in turn, is predicated on the nature of the proximate behavioral mechanisms. We model a particular class of proximate mechanisms, prosocial preferences, and find that such preferences evolve to sustain maximum group benefit under certain levels of relatedness and certain ecological conditions. Thus, our model demonstrates the fundamental interplay between behavioral responses and relatedness in determining the course of social evolution. We also highlight the crucial role of proximate mechanisms such as prosocial preferences in the evolution of behavioral responses and in facilitating evolutionary transitions in individuality.",how and when do group optimal behaviors evolve.

Confronted with such diversity, nonspecialists may have difficulties judging the scope and limitations of the various approaches. Here we review the major modeling frameworks, highlighting their pros and cons when applied to different research questions. We also discuss recent developments, where classical models are enriched by including more detail regarding genetics, behavior, demography, and population dynamics. It turns out that some seemingly well-established conclusions of sexual selection theory are less general than previously thought.

Nevertheless, the question of whether the etiology is the same for different levels of DSMIV ADHD symptoms remains to be investigated. The aim of this study was to assess genetic links between the extreme and the subthreshold range of ADHD symptoms. Method: Parents of all Swedish 9- and 12-year-old twins born between 1992 and 2000 were interviewed for DSM-IV ADHD symptoms and associated conditions. Two validated cutoff values were used for screening and assigning research diagnoses. Response rate was 80%. Twin methods were applied to investigate the extent to which ADHD is etiologically distinct from subthreshold variations in ADHD symptoms. Results: Extremes analyses indicated a strong genetic link between the extreme and the subthreshold variation, with almost identical group heritability estimates around .60 for the diagnostic ( prevalence 1.78%) and screening ( prevalence 9.75%) criteria of ADHD. Conclusion: A strong genetic link between the extreme and the subthreshold variation of DSM-IV based assessments of ADHD symptoms was found.

To understand why trade-off may arise we need to study the genetic and non-genetic factors that influence associated traits because these may respond differently to selective pressure. Research into trade-offs has largely focused on the genetic basis of associated traits, yet both maternal effects and epigenetic effects have recently been shown to affect life history traits that play a role in trade-offs. In this study, we analyze genetic, epigenetic and life-history predictors of one of the most important trade-offs, that between offspring number and offspring mortality. Using a large-scale 3-generational intercross between two divergent mouse lines C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, we show that litter size differences between these lines, although significant, are surprisingly not the most important predictors of mortality. Offspring genotype, maternal effects and their interactions are the most influential factors determining mortality. We found significant paternal effects suggesting an important influence of paternal care or potentially the role of imprinted genes. Perhaps contrary to expectations our results further show that the trade-off between offspring number and mortality is not just a simple function of the two factors yielding, on average, an 'optimal' litter size at weaning. Indeed if one focused on litter size and mortality alone, the slope of relationship is the same for the two lines, yet they differ in the number of young at weaning. Our study reveals that a perceived trade-off between two traits is governed by a more complex set of interactions between genetic and non-genetic effects.","tradeoffs between offspring number and offspring mortality investigated to identify genetic, epienetic and life history predictors.",Mus musculus,mouse,Mammalia,3-generational intercross between two divergent lines,3 generation intercross,not a behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,m,,not human

We present the results of a behavioural study with a sample of 1456 genetically heterogeneous N/Nih-HS rats, including males and females, which are part of a larger genome-wide fine-mapping QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) study. N/Nih-HS rats have been derived from 8 inbred strains and provide very small distance between genetic recombinations, which makes them a unique tool for fine-mapping QTL studies. The behavioural test battery comprised the elevated zero-maze test for anxiety, novel-cage (open-field like) activity, two-way active avoidance acquisition (related to conditioned anxiety) and context-conditioned freezing (i.e. classically conditioned fear). Using factorial analyses of variance (ANOVAs) we aimed to analyse sex differences in anxiety and fear in this N/Nih-HS rat sample, as well as to assess the effects of (and interactions with) other independent factors, such as batch, season, coat colour and experimenter. Body weight was taken as a quantitative covariate and analysed by covariance analysis (ANCOVA). Obliquely-rotated factor analyses were also performed separately for each sex, in order to evaluate associations among the most relevant variables from each behavioural test and the common dimensions (i.e. factors) underlying the different behavioural responses. ANOVA analyses showed a consistent pattern of sex effects, with females showing less signs of anxiety and fear than males across all tests. There were also significant main effects of batch, season, colour and experimenter on almost all behavioural variables, as well as ""sex x batch"", ""sex x season"" and ""sex x experimenter"" interactions. Body weight showed significant effects in the ANCOVAs of most behavioural measures, but sex effects were still present in spite of (and after controlling for) these ""body weight"" effects. Factor analyses of relevant variables from each test showed a two-fold factor structure in both sexes, with the first factor mainly representing anxiety and conditioned fear in males, while in females the first factor was dominated by loadings of activity measures. Thus, besides showing consistent sex differences in anxiety-, fear- and activity-related responses in N/Nih-HS rats, the present study shows that females' behaviour is predominantly influenced by activity while males are more influenced by anxiety. Moreover, the results point out that, besides ""sex"" effects, physiological variables such as colour and body weight, and environmental factors as batch/season or ""experimenter"", have to be taken into account in both behavioural and quantitative genetic studies because of their demonstrated influences on phenotypic outcomes.","consistent sex differences in anxiety-, fear- and activity-related responses",Rattus norvegicus,rats,Mammalia,behavioral analysis of QTL mapping study using inbred lines,"QTL mapping, inbred lines",environmental effects also need to be taken into account,no,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

We will address the question of whether the child is father of the Man from a genetic perspective. In other words, do the same genetic influences affect the same traits across development? Using a taster menu approach and prioritizing newer findings on cognitive and behavioral traits, examples from the following genetic disciplines will be discussed: (a) developmental quantitative genetics (such as longitudinal twin studies), (b) neurodevelopmental genetic syndromes with known genetic causes (such as Williams syndrome), (c) developmental candidate gene studies (such as those that link infant and adult populations), (d) developmental genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and (e) DNA resequencing. Evidence presented here suggests that there is considerable genetic stability of cognitive and behavioral traits across development, but there is also evidence for genetic change.

We tested this idea by analyzing parental care reaction norms in a bird that exhibits biparental care. Personality in provisioning behavior existed (r(IC) = 0.11) and persisted despite being reduced after accounting for individual differences in environment. Plasticity was also evident and differed between the sexes. Male visit rate was associated with changes in brood size and time of day, but female visit rate was associated with changes in nestling age and date. In both sexes changes in visit rate were positively correlated with changes in their partner's visit rate. Both sexes also exhibited multidimensional reaction norms; interaction terms revealed that within-individual visit rates increased more steeply with brood size when nestlings were older, and the effect of the partner's visit rate was sensitive to variation in date, precipitation, and the focal bird's age. Individuals also varied in how they responded (reaction norm slope) to changes in nestling age and partner visits. Moreover, parental personality was interdependent with individual plasticity in several ways. Individuals of both sexes with a high visit rate also responded more positively to changes in nestling age, and males also showed this pattern with changes in partner visit rate. Explicit use of the behavioral reaction norm integrated personality and plasticity, revealed that these are not opposing concepts, and stimulated new hypotheses about sexual conflict over care and provisioning as a life-history trait.",personality in provisioning behavior persisted and plasticity was evident but differed between the sexes.

Santtila, Pekka", Genetic analysis of orgasmic function in twins and siblings does not   support the by-product theory of female orgasm,82,2011," The evolutionary basis of human female orgasm has been subject to furious scientific debate, which has recently intensified. Many adaptive explanations have been proposed, invoking functions from pair bonding and mate selection to sucking up sperm, but these have been attacked as being based on flawed logic and/or evidence. The popular alternative theory is that female orgasm is not adaptive and is only evolutionarily maintained as a by-product of ongoing selection on the male orgasm-ejaculation system. This theory has not been adequately tested. We tested one of its central tenets: that selection pressure on the male orgasm is partially transmitted to the female via a positive cross-sex correlation in orgasmic function (susceptibility to orgasm in response to sexual stimulation). Using questionnaire data from over 10 000 Finnish twins and siblings, we found significant genetic variation in both male and female orgasmic function, but no significant correlation between opposite-sex twins and siblings. This suggests that different genetic factors underlie male and female orgasmic function and that selection pressures on male orgasmic function do not act substantively on female orgasmic function. These results challenge the by-product theory of female orgasm. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Using the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, we tested the conditions under which dispersal distance could evolve. To this aim, we performed artificial selection based on dispersal distance by choosing 40 individuals (out of 150) that settled furthest from the home patch (high dispersal, HDIS) and 40 individuals that remained close to the home patch (low dispersal, LDIS) with three replicates per treatment. We did not observe a response to selection nor a difference between treatments in life-history traits (fecundity, survival, longevity, and sex-ratio) after ten generations of selection.

Heritability for dispersal distance was low and non-significant when using the same density as the artificial selection experiments while heritability becomes significant at a lower density. Furthermore, we show that maternal effects may have influenced the dispersal behaviour of the mites.

Reijo", Pumilio-2 Function in the Mouse Nervous System,6,2011," Coordinated mRNA translation at the synapse is increasingly recognized as a critical mechanism for neuronal regulation. Pumilio, a translational regulator, is known to be involved in neuronal homeostasis and memory formation in Drosophila. Most recently, the mammalian Pumilio homolog Pumilio-2 (Pum2) has been found to play a role in the mammalian nervous system, in particular in regulating morphology, arborization and excitability of neuronal dendrites, in vitro. However, the role of Pum2 in vivo remains unclear. Here, we report our investigation of the functional and molecular consequences of Pum2 disruption in vivo using an array of neurophysiology, behavioral and gene expression profiling techniques. We used Pum2-deficient mice to monitor in vivo brain activity using EEG and to study behavior traits, including memory, locomotor activity and nesting capacities. Because of the suspected role of Pum2 in neuronal excitability, we also examined the susceptibility to seizure induction. Finally, we used a quantitative gene expression profiling assay to identify key molecular partners of Pum2. We found that Pum2-deficient mice have abnormal behavioral strategies in spatial and object memory test. Additionally, Pum2 deficiency is associated with increased locomotor activity and decreased body weight. We also observed environmentally-induced impairment in nesting behavior. Most importantly, Pum2-deficient mice showed spontaneous EEG abnormalities and had lower seizure thresholds using a convulsing dosage of pentylenetetrazole. Finally, some genes, including neuronal ion channels, were differentially expressed in the hippocampus of Pum2-deficient mice. These findings demonstrate that Pum2 serves key functions in the adult mammalian central nervous system encompassing neuronal excitability and behavioral response to environmental challenges.",not relevant,,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

We found significant additive genetic variance for two mass-independent metabolic measures (RMR and the average metabolic rate throughout the respirometry run) and two behavioural measures (time spent in centre and distance moved in a novel environment). We also detected positive additive genetic correlation between mass-independent RMR and distance moved (r(A) = 0.78 +/- 0.23).

For populations with extreme allele frequencies, high V(A)/V(G) can be explained without considering properties of the genotype-phenotype (GP) map. We show that randomly generated GP maps in populations with intermediate allele frequencies generate far lower V(A)/V(G) values than empirically observed. The main reason is that order-breaking behaviour is ubiquitous in random GP maps. Rearrangement of genotypic values to introduce order-preservation for one or more loci causes a dramatic increase in V(A)/V(G). This suggests the existence of order-preserving design principles in the regulatory machinery underlying GP maps.

Feeding stimulates spermatogenesis, mating and insemination of male factors that trigger female reproduction. The physiology of male reproduction and its regulation of female development are essentially a black box. Several transcriptomes have catalogued expression of tick genes in the salivary glands, synganglion and midgut but no comprehensive investigation has addressed male reproduction and mating. Consequently, a new global approach using transcriptomics, proteomics, and quantitative gene expression is needed to understand male reproduction and stimulation of female reproduction. This first transcriptome to the reproductive biology of fed male ticks, Dermacentor variabilis, was obtained by 454 pyrosequencing (563,093 reads, 12,804 contigs). Gene Ontology (Biological Processes level III) recognized 3,866 transcripts in 73 different categories; spermiogenesis; spermatogenesis; peptidases, lipases and hydrolases; oxidative and environmental stress; immune defense; and protein binding. Reproduction-associated genes included serine/threonine kinase, metalloendoproteinases, ferritins, serine proteases, trypsin, cysteine proteases, serpins, a cystatin, GPCR and others. qRT-PCR showed significant upregulation from unfed versus fed adult male reproductive organs of zinc metalloprotease, astacin metalloprotease and serine protease, enzymes important in spermiogenesis and mating activity in insects, as well as a GPCR with the greatest similarity to a SIFamide receptor known to be important in regulating courtship behavior in Drosophila. Proteomics on these organs and the spermatophore by tryptic digestion/Liquid chromatography/Mass spectrometry/Mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) demonstrated expression of many of the same messages found by 454 sequencing, supporting their identification, and revealed differences in protein distribution in the reproductive system versus the spermatophore. We found Ef alpha but no EF beta in the transcriptome and neither of these proteins in the spermatophore. Thus, the previously described model for male regulation of female reproduction may not apply to other ticks.

Ecophysiological traits typically vary depending on local conditions and contribute to resource acquisition and allocation, yet correlations may limit adaptive trait expression. Notably, photosynthesis and stomatal conductance vary diurnally, and the circadian clock, which is an internal estimate of time that anticipates diurnal light/dark cycles, may synchronize physiological behaviors with environmental conditions. Using recombinant inbred lines of Brassica rapa, we examined the quantitative-genetic architecture of ecophysiological and phenological traits and tested their association with the circadian clock. We also investigated how trait expression differed across treatments that simulated seasonal settings encountered by crops and naturalized populations. Many ecophysiological traits were correlated, and some correlations were consistent with expected biophysical constraints; for example, stomata jointly regulate photosynthesis and transpiration by affecting carbon dioxide and water vapor diffusion across leaf surfaces, and these traits were correlated. Interestingly, some genotypes had unusual combinations of ecophysiological traits, such as high photosynthesis in combination with low stomatal conductance or leaf nitrogen, and selection on these genotypes could provide a mechanism for crop improvement. At the genotypic and QTL level, circadian period was correlated with leaf nitrogen, instantaneous measures of photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance as well as with a long-term proxy (carbon isotope discrimination) for gas exchange, suggesting that gas exchange is partly regulated by the clock and thus synchronized with daily light cycles.

Despite the ubiquity of phenotypic variation within natural populations, its effects on the dynamics of ecological communities are not well understood. Here, we use a quantitative genetics framework to examine how phenotypic variation in a predator affects the outcome of apparent competition between its two prey species. Classical apparent competition theory predicts that prey have reciprocally negative effects on each other. The addition of phenotypic trait variation in predation can marginalize these negative effects, mediate coexistence, or generate positive indirect effects between the prey species. Long-term coexistence or facilitation, however, can be preceded by long transients of extinction risk whenever the heritability of phenotypic variation is low. Greater heritability can circumvent these ecological transients but also can generate oscillatory and chaotic dynamics. These dramatic changes in ecological outcomes, in the sign of indirect effects, and in stability suggest that studies which ignore intraspecific trait variation may reach fundamentally incorrect conclusions regarding ecological dynamics.",phenotypic variation in a predator affects outcome of two prey species,,,,quantitative genetic framework theory - theoretical model,mathematical model,greater heritability can circumvent ecological transients but can generate oscillatory and chaotic dynamics.

Currently, the preferred stem cells are primary, non-immunogenic satellite cells (= myoblasts). The objective of this study was to determine the expression patterns of myogenic markers within the human satellite cell population during their differentiation into multinucleated myotubes for an accurate characterization of stem cell behaviour. Satellite cells were incubated (for 1, 4, 8, 12 or 16 days) with a culture medium containing either a low [= differentiation medium (DM)] or high [= growth medium (GM)] concentration of growth factors. Furthermore, we performed a quantitative gene expression analysis of well-defined differentiation makers: myogenic factor 5 (MYF5), myogenin (MYOG), skeletal muscle aactin1 (ACTA1), embryonic (MYH3), perinatal (MYH8) and adult skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain (MYH1). Additionally, the fusion indices of forming myotubes of MYH1, MYH8 and ACTA1 were calculated. We show that satellite cells incubated with DM expressed multiple characteriztic features of mature skeletal muscles, verified by time-dependent upregulation of MYOG, MYH1, MYH3, MYH8 and ACTA1. However, satellite cells incubated with GM did not reveal all morphological aspects of muscle differentiation. Immunocytochemical investigations with antibodies directed against the differentiation markers showed correlations between the gene expression and differentiation. Our data provide information about time-dependent gene expression of differentiation markers in human satellite cells, which can be used for maturation analyses in skeletal muscle tissue-engineering applications.

We decomposed the complex begging display of yellow-legged gull, Larus michahellis, chicks into two different functional components: begging for food (pecks) and drawing the attention of parents (chatter calls). We examined these begging components in 2-day-old chicks that hatched and grew up in foster nests, by performing a begging test for each chick alone without the hindrance of its foster siblings. Male chicks and those with poorer body condition begged for food at higher rates than females and those with better body condition, respectively. Chicks from larger broods begged for food more frequently, but chicks from male-biased broods begged less frequently. If begging is costly, chicks may adjust their begging efforts to the intensity of sibling competition. Frequency of chatter calls varied with sex, chick order within broods and body condition: females, the third chicks and those with poorer condition produced chatter calls more frequently. Genetic origin had a significant effect on frequency of chatter calls but not on begging for food, while foster nest effect was null in both traits. Therefore, chatter calls (but not pecks) can be subject to evolution under directional selection. Different begging components may have evolved through different evolutionary pathways.

ADHD symptoms were assessed as continuous dimensions using the DSM-IV items from the Conners' Parent Rating Scale at two ages: middle childhood (age 1) and early adolescence (age 2). Quantitative genetic cross-lagged analyses showed that the association of the ADHD dimensions over time is influenced by stable as well as newly developing genetic factors. Moreover the longitudinal relationship between the ADHD dimensions appears to be unidirectional, with hyperactivity-impulsivity in middle childhood predicting the presence of inattentiveness in early adolescence, but not vice versa.

This observation has remained a puzzle for evolutionary biologists: although mating outside the pair bond can obviously increase the offspring production of males, the benefits of such behavior to females are less clear, yet females are known to actively solicit extrapair copulations. For more than two decades adaptionist explanations have dominated the discussions, yet remain controversial, and genetic constraint arguments have been dismissed without much consideration. An intriguing but still untested hypothesis states that extrapair mating behavior by females may be affected by the same genetic variants (alleles) as extrapair mating behavior bymales, such that the female behavior could evolve through indirect selection on the male behavior. Here we show that in the socially monogamous zebra finch, individual differences in extrapair mating behavior have a hereditary component. Intriguingly, this genetic basis is shared between the sexes, as shown by a strong genetic correlation between male and female measurements of extrapair mating behavior. Hence, positive selection on males to sire extrapair young will lead to increased extrapair mating by females as a correlated evolutionary response. This behavior leads to a fundamentally different view of female extrapair mating: it may exist even if females obtain no net benefit from it, simply because the corresponding alleles were positively selected in the male ancestors.",individual differences in extrapair mating behavior have a hereditary component shared between the sexes - female EPCs could evolve through correlated selection/pleiotropy,Taeniopygia guttata,zebra finch,Aves,quantitative genetic analysis,cross-foster,correlation between sexes suggests explanation for female polyandry,maybe,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

The research also converges on the remarkable conclusion that these environmental influences make two children in the same family as different from one another as are pairs of children selected randomly from the population.   The theme of the target article is that environmental differences between children in the same family (called ""nonshared environment"") represent the major source of environmental variance for personality, psychopathology, and cognitive abilities. One example of the evidence that supports this conclusion involves correlations for pairs of adopted children reared in the same family from early in life. Because these children share family environment but not heredity, their correlation directly estimates the importance of shared family environment. For most psychological characteristics, correlations for adoptive ""siblings"" hover near zero, which implies that the relevant environmental influences are not shared by children in the same family. Although it has been thought that cognitive abilities represent an exception to this rule, recent data suggest that environmental variance that affects IQ is also of the nonshared variety after adolescence.   The article has three goals: (1) To describe quantitative genetic methods and research that lead to the conclusion that nonshared environment is responsible for most environmental variation relevant to psychological development, (2) to discuss specific nonshared environmental influences that have been studied to date, and (3) to consider relationships between nonshared environmental influences and behavioral differences between children in the same family. The reason for presenting this article in BBS is to draw attention to the far-reaching implications of finding that psychologically relevant environmental influences make children in a family different from, not similar to, one another.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Size differences among species or between populations are often explained by adaptive scenarios invoking the action of selection, although studies of selection in action on primate body size, or other phenotypic traits, are very rare. We document directional selection for larger skull and postcranial size in the skeletons of female semi-free ranging rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatto) from Cayo Santiago, born between 1957 and 1982. Larger females live to later ages and consequently give birth to more offspring. Despite selection for larger size, there are indications of a trend toward generally smaller size in the same birth cohorts. This trend is provisionally attributed to increasing population density, though other environmental factors may play a role. Small selection differentials and low heritabilities also limit the genetic response to selection. Alternative explanations for increasing adult size in the skull and postcranium, such as continued adult growth or pathological bone deposition, do not adequately explain the observed age-related trends and are inconsistent with longitudinal studies of adult skeletal change.

However, for behaviors, the concordance between phenotypic and genetic correlations has not been rigorously examined. I tested this assumption using published estimates and found phenotypic and genetic correlations to be strongly related but found that the average absolute difference between the two was quite high and similar to that observed in other traits. Using absolute differences as the sole criterion, phenotypic correlations do not reliably estimate the magnitude of genetic correlations for behaviors, which is problematic for behavioral syndrome researchers. However, phenotypic correlations explained 75% of the variation in genetic correlations and their sign was typically the same as that of genetic correlations. This suggests that phenotypic correlations between behaviors reliably estimate the direction of underling genetic relationships and provide considerable information regarding the magnitude of genetic correlations. Thus, if researchers are careful about the questions they ask, phenotypic correlations between behaviors can be informative regarding underlying genetic correlations and their evolutionary implications.","phenotypic correlations and genetic correlations for behavioral syndromes are related but phenotypic corrlations do not reliably estimate the magnitude of genetic correlations, but explain 75%of variation and generally had the same sign.

To address this overall objective, a quantitative genetics project focused on investigation of male reproductive traits was designed and linked to three female reproduction-focussed projects, (i) discovery of genes associated with post-partum re-conception and age at puberty; (ii) expression of genes associated with post-partum re-conception; and (iii) early predictors of lifetime female reproductive performance. During the initial planning of this male reproductive traits project, the CRC Scientific Review Committee recommended that the research team investigate and evaluate potentially new, early-life (i.e able to be measured before 2 years of age) predictors of both male and female reproductive performance. To address this recommendation, the following was carried out: (i) criteria for selection of traditional and candidate traits were established; (ii) methodology for tabulation of potential traits/phenotypes that define male and female reproductive function was developed; and (iii) a systematic scientific review of early-life predictors of male and female fertility was prepared. This review concluded that although factors that might be useful in predicting male reproductive performance have been studied for many years, there was relatively little useful information available to meet the objectives of this review. It was also concluded that the direction of future research should be guided not only by previous research which was scarce, but also by speculative hypotheses arising from an understanding of the physiological, endocrinological and genetic processes active in reproduction. A small number of new traits were recommended in addition to traditional sperm morphology, sexual behaviour, anatomical structure and growth traits. Potential additional traits include measurement of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-stimulated luteinizing hormone (GnRH-stimulated LH); inhibin; several seminal plasma proteins (osteopontin, spermadhesin and seminal plasma proteins BSP30 and phospholipase A(2) could be used in an index); 11 beta-hydroxysteriod dehydrogenase; and leptin. In addition, the potential also exists to screen animals for a number of genetic markers associated with age of puberty, follicular recruitment and ovulation rate and genes associated with bovine seminal plasma protein and testosterone production. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) measurements are included because of their association with growth parameters, and an additional analysis demonstrated associations with male and female reproductive traits. Some of these factors have been previously evaluated in small numbers of animals of various species under intensive management conditions. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate these factors in much larger numbers of beef cattle grazing semi-extensive tropical production systems in northern Australia to determine their value in improving beef cattle enterprise profitability through improved herd fertility.","quantitative genetics project focused on male reproductive traits linked the three female reproduction focused projects, including reproductive performancce traits in femles.

To be able to incorporate these non-Mendelian features into quantitative genetic models, it is necessary to study the induction and the transgenerational behavior of epialleles in controlled settings. Here we outline a general experimental approach for achieving this using crosses of epigenomically perturbed isogenic lines in mammalian and plant species. We develop a theoretical description of such crosses and model the relationship between epiallelic instability, recombination, parent-of-origin effects, as well as transgressive segregation and their joint impact on phenotypic variation across generations. In the limiting case of fully stable epialleles our approach reduces to the classical theory of experimental line crosses and thus illustrates a fundamental continuity between genetic and epigenetic inheritance. We consider data from a panel of Arabidopsis epigenetic recombinant inbred lines and explore estimates of the number of quantitative trait loci for plant height that resulted from a manipulation of DNA methylation levels in one of the two isogenic founder strains.",not behavior,,,,review of how to study chromatin epigenetic effects,,not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS," Nonacs, P   Hager, RAF Nonacs, Peter   Hager, Reinmar"," The past, present and future of reproductive skew theory and experiments",86,2011," A major evolutionary question is how reproductive sharing arises in cooperatively breeding species despite the inherent reproductive conflicts in social groups. Reproductive skew theory offers one potential solution: each group member gains or is allotted inclusive fitness equal to or exceeding their expectation from reproducing on their own. Unfortunately, a multitude of skew models with conflicting predictions has led to confusion in both testing and evaluating skew theory. The confusion arises partly because one set of models (the 'transactional' type) answer the ultimate evolutionary question of what ranges of reproductive skew can yield fitness-enhancing solutions for all group members. The second set of models ('compromise') give an evolutionarily proximate, game-theoretic evolutionarily stable state (ESS) solution that determines reproductive shares based on relative competitive abilities. However, several predictions arising from compromise models require a linear payoff to increased competition and do not hold with non-linear payoffs. Given that for most species it may be very difficult or impossible to determine the true relationship between effort devoted to competition and reproductive share gained, compromise models are much less predictive than previously appreciated. Almost all skew models make one quantitative prediction (e.g. realized skew must fall within ranges predicted by transactional models), and two qualitative predictions (e.g. variation in relatedness or competitive ability across groups affects skew). A thorough review of the data finds that these three predictions are relatively rarely supported. As a general rule, therefore, the evolution of cooperative breeding appears not to be dependent on the ability of group members to monitor relatedness or competitive ability in order to adjust their behaviour dynamically to gain reproductive share. Although reproductive skew theory fails to predict within-group dynamics consistently, it does better at predicting quantitative differences in skew across populations or species. This suggests that kin selection can play a significant role in the evolution of sociality. To advance our understanding of reproductive skew will require focusing on a broader array of factors, such as the frequency of mistaken identity, delayed fitness payoffs, and selection pressures arising from across-group competition. We furthermore suggest a novel approach to investigate the sharing of reproduction that focuses on the underlying genetics of skew. A quantitative genetics approach allows the partitioning of variance in reproductive share itself or that of traits closely associated with skew into genetic and non-genetic sources. Thus, we can determine the heritability of reproductive share and infer whether it actually is the focus of natural selection. We view the 'animal model' as the most promising empirical method where the genetics of reproductive share can be directly analyzed in wild populations. In the quest to assess whether skew theory can provide a framework for understanding the evolution of sociality, quantitative genetics will be a central tool in future research.",advocate for reproductive skew and cooperative breeding research to use the quantitative genetics framework of the animal model,,,,review/syntheis,,don't think it's particularly relevant,probably not,,,x,,,,,,,,x,x,,,,,,not human

Twin data show that the occurrence of such events in childhood contributes to explaining the covariation between separation anxiety disorder, panic, and the related psychobiological trait of CO2 hypersensitivity. We hypothesized that early interference with infant-mother interaction could moderate the interspecific trait of response to CO2 through genetic control of sensitivity to the environment.   Methodology: Having spent the first 24 hours after birth with their biological mother, outbred NMRI mice were cross-fostered to adoptive mothers for the following 4 post-natal days. They were successively compared to normally-reared individuals for: number of ultrasonic vocalizations during isolation, respiratory physiology responses to normal air (20%O-2), CO2-enriched air (6% CO2), hypoxic air (10%O-2), and avoidance of CO2-enriched environments.   Results: Cross-fostered pups showed significantly more ultrasonic vocalizations, more pronounced hyperventilatory responses (larger tidal volume and minute volume increments) to CO2-enriched air and heightened aversion towards CO2-enriched environments, than normally-reared individuals. Enhanced tidal volume increment response to 6% CO2 was present at 16-20, and 75-90 postnatal days, implying the trait's stability. Quantitative genetic analyses of unrelated individuals, sibs and half-sibs, showed that the genetic variance for tidal volume increment during 6% CO2 breathing was significantly higher (Bartlett chi = 8.3, p = 0.004) among the cross-fostered than the normally-reared individuals, yielding heritability of 0.37 and 0.21 respectively. These results support a stress-diathesis model whereby the genetic influences underlying the response to 6% CO2 increase their contribution in the presence of an environmental adversity. Maternal grooming/licking behaviour, and corticosterone basal levels were similar among cross-fostered and normally-reared individuals.   Conclusions: A mechanism of gene-by-environment interplay connects this form of early perturbation of infant-mother interaction, heightened CO2 sensitivity and anxiety.

The genomic model commonly found in the literature, with marker effects affecting mean only, is extended to investigate putative effects at the level of the environmental variance. Two classes of models are proposed and their behaviour, studied using simulated data, indicates that they are capable of detecting genetic variation at the level of mean and variance. Implementation is via Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) algorithms. The models are compared in terms of a measure of global fit, in their ability to detect QTL effects and in terms of their predictive power. The models are subsequently fitted to back fat thickness data in pigs. The analysis of back fat thickness shows that the data support genomic models with effects on the mean but not on the variance.

In this study, we explored the embryonic development and the temporal behavioral interaction of the genes involved in IFN tau gene expression and how they behave in an orchestrated manner to increase the developmental competence of IVF produced embryos by culturing in the chemically defined medium. Behavior of genes included ETS2, CDX2, GATA2, GATA3, OCT4 and NANOG was analyzed in early bovine IVF produced embryos, (from compact morulae to the blastocyst hatching stages), by semi- and relative quantitative PCR and compared between two in vitro culture (IVC) systems, two-step chemically defined medium and modified synthetic oviductal fluid (mSOF) containing 8 mg/mL, BSA. Early embryonic development was found to be better in two-step chemically defined culture system than that of mSOF as indicated by the increment of blastocyst yield, 33.1% in two-step culture system vs 18.8% in mSOF medium, and the blastocyst hatching, 52.3% in two-step culture system vs 33.5% in mSOF medium. Relative quantitative gene expression showed harmonic behavior in the two-step culture system rather than the culture in mSOF, IFN tau showed even increase throughout the embryonic development in the two-step culture medium while it decreased with blastocyst hatching in mSOF culture condition. Temporal dominance cif OCT4 over all the transcription factors was found in regulation of IFN tau expression (the major factor of expression regulation but in inverse manner). However, ETS2, CDX2, GATA2 and GATA3 are potent IFN tau stimulator in cumulative manner but in case of OCT4 decrement. CDX2 directly related with IFN tau, but still under OCT4 dominance and also regulated by the subservient of OCT4 which is NANOG. In conclusion, this study confirmed our previous results about the usefulness of using the two-step chemically defined culture medium for increasing the developmental competence of IVF produced. embryos and elucidated the dominance of OCT4 over the other genes implicated in regulation of IFN tau expression.

For example, on the one hand, high yield in dairy cows may increase the liability to certain diseases and, on the other hand, the incidence of a disease may affect yield negatively. Likewise, the transcriptome may be a function of the reproductive status in mammals and the latter may depend on other physiological variables. Knowledge of phenotype networks describing such interrelationships can be used to predict the behavior of complex systems, e.g. biological pathways underlying complex traits such as diseases, growth and reproduction. Structural Equation Models (SEM) can be used to study recursive and simultaneous relationships among phenotypes in multivariate systems such as genetical genomics, system biology, and multiple trait models in quantitative genetics. Hence, SEM can produce an interpretation of relationships among traits which differs from that obtained with traditional multiple trait models, in which all relationships are represented by symmetric linear associations among random variables, such as covariances and correlations. In this review, we discuss the application of SEM and related techniques for the study of multiple phenotypes. Two basic scenarios are considered, one pertaining to genetical genomics studies, in which QTL or molecular marker information is used to facilitate causal inference, and another related to quantitative genetic analysis in livestock, in which only phenotypic and pedigree information is available.

In order for gynodioecy to evolve from hermaphroditism, the carriers of a male-sterility mutation (i.e., females) must overcome two major hurdles: females must attract pollinators without offering pollen as a reward, and they must produce enough seeds to compensate for the loss of reproduction through the paternal route. We investigated the relative performance of female and hermaphroditic plants in a greenhouse study of Mimulus guttatus originating from a largely hermaphroditic population. Females had larger floral displays than did hermaphrodites, with 5% wider corollas and 34% more flowers open at one time. They also produced 22% more flowers over a lifetime and 25% more ovules per ovary than hermaphrodites, giving females 1.53 times more maternal reproductive potential. In a related experiment, bumblebees visited female plants just as frequently as hermaphroditic plants, even though the females offered no pollen reward. Although the relative advantages enjoyed by females may be insufficient to overcome the obstacles for the evolution of stable gynodioecy, they might be strong enough to explain the maintenance of genetic variation for male-sterility alleles often observed in natural populations of M. guttatus.",plants,,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

We also examined the patterns of SD in a set of 38 wild populations from different habitats to investigate the relationship between the genetic architecture of SD of the marine ancestral population in relation to variation within and among natural populations.

Deciding where to place eggs is likely one of the most important decisions for a female fly, as eggs are vulnerable and larvae have limited motility. Here, we show that many natural genotypes of D. melanogaster prefer to lay eggs near nutritious substrate, rather than in nutritious substrate. These preferences are highly polymorphic in both degree and direction, with considerable heritability (0.488) and evolvability. Relative preferences are modulated by the distance between options and the overall concentration of ethanol, suggesting Drosophila integrate many environmental factors when making oviposition decisions. As oviposition-related decisions can be efficiently assessed by simply counting eggs, oviposition behavior is an excellent model for understanding information processing in insects.

 J, ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE," Flueck, WT   Smith-Flueck, JAMAF Flueck, Werner T.   Smith-Flueck, Jo Anne M.", Intraspecific phenotypic variation in deer: the role of genetic and   epigenetic processes,51,2011," Intraspecific phenotypic variation (PV) in deer is common, at times impressively diverse, and involves morphology, development, physiology, and behaviour. Until recently considered a nuisance in evolutionary and taxonomic studies, PV has become the primary target to study fossil and extant species. Phenotypes are traditionally interpreted to express primarily interactions of inherited genetic variants. PV certainly originates from different genotypes, but additional PV, referred to as phenotypic plasticity (PP), results from gene expression responsive to environmental conditions and other epigenetic factors. Usage of 'epigenetics' for PP has increased exponentially with 20 316 published papers (Web-of-Science 1990 - May 2010), yet it does not include a single paper on cervids (1900 to the present). During the 'genomic era', the focus was on the primary DNA sequences and variability therein. Recently however, several higher order architectural genomic features were detected which all affect PV.   (1) Genes: poli-genic traits; pleiotropic genes; poli-allelic genes; gene dosage (copy number variants, CNV); single nucleotide variance in coding and gene regulatory regions; mtDNA recombinations and paternal mtDNA inheritance.   (2) Gene products: pleiotropic gene products; multiple protein structures through alternative splicing; variable gene product reactions due to gene dosage.   (3) Gene expression: (i) epigenetic regulation at the DNA, nucleosomal and chromosomal levels; (ii) large-scale genomic structural variation (i.e. CNV imbalance); (iii) transcription factor proteins (TF), each regulating up to 500 target genes, with TF activity varying 7.5-25% among individual humans (exceeding variation in coding DNA by 300-1000x); (iv) non-protein-coding RNA (98.5% of genome) constituting maybe hundreds of thousands RNA signals; (v) gene expression responsive to external and internal environmental variation; (vi) transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (e. g. from ubiquitous non-gametic interactions, genomic imprinting, epistasis, transgenerational gene-diet interactions); (vii) epigenetic stochasticity resulting in random PP. A unique example of labile traits in mammals is the yearly regrowth of a complete appendage, the antler in cervids.   Highly complex assortments of genotypes lead to a spectrum of phenotypes, yet the same spectrum can result if a single genotype generates highly complex assortments of epigenotypes. Although DNA is the template for the DNA-RNA-protein paradigm of heredity, it is the coordination and regulation of gene expression that results in wide complexity and diversity seen among individual deer, and per-generation variety of phenotypes available for selection are greater than available genotypes. In conclusion, epigenetic processes have fundamental influences on the great intraspecific PV found in deer, which is reflected in broad ranges of environmental conditions under which they can persist. Deer management and conservation of endangered cervids will benefit from appreciating the large inherent PV among individuals and the immense contribution of epigenetics in all aspects of deer biology and ecology.",not behavior,Cervus,deer,Mammalia,review,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Smoking and   Drinking Patterns in Danish Twins,173,2011," More education is associated with healthier smoking and drinking behaviors. Most analyses of effects of education focus on mean levels. Few studies have compared variance in health-related behaviors at different levels of education or analyzed how education impacts underlying genetic and environmental sources of health-related behaviors. This study explored these influences. In a 2002 postal questionnaire, 21,522 members of the Danish Twin Registry, born during 1931-1982, reported smoking and drinking habits. The authors used quantitative genetic models to examine how these behaviors' genetic and environmental variances differed with level of education, adjusting for birth-year effects. As expected, more education was associated with less smoking, and average drinking levels were highest among the most educated. At 2 standard deviations above the mean educational level, variance in smoking and drinking was about one-third that among those at 2 standard deviations below, because fewer highly educated people reported high levels of smoking or drinking. Because shared environmental variance was particularly restricted, one explanation is that education created a culture that discouraged smoking and heavy drinking. Correlations between shared environmental influences on education and the health behaviors were substantial among the well-educated for smoking in both sexes and drinking in males, reinforcing this notion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

In order to understand their evolutionary significance, it is relevant to know the heritability of these traits and how they relate to reproductive success. This might give insights into selective processes that maintain variation as well as into potential trade-offs. We scored approach to novel objects of 530 captive zebra finches in a familiar environment. Scores were highly repeatable and showed substantial additive genetic variation. We measured reproductive success, promiscuity, and extrapair paternity rates under aviary conditions and calculated linear and nonlinear selection differentials based on fertilization success as well as effects on chick-rearing success of pairs. Approach to novel objects had little influence on these components of reproductive success. However, we found that the social environment ( manipulated operational sex ratios) influenced the correlation between approach to a novel object and the proportion of extrapair paternity. We also found that the sex ratio manipulation affected measures of the intensity of sexual selection. Both effects were stronger in males than in females. We conclude that despite the lack of differences in overall reproductive success, approach to novel objects reflects variation in reproductive strategies.",personality might show unexpected cross-context correltions and explain maladaptive behavior. ,Taeniopygia guttata,zebra finch,Aves,common garden,common-garden,"personality had little influence on reproductive success, promiscuity, and EPP. social environment influencced correlation between exploratory behavior and EPP.

Fortunately, many of the methodological and theoretical issues currently being dealt with by behavioural ecologists within the context of behavioural syndromes have previously been investigated by researchers in other areas of evolutionary ecology. As a result of these previous efforts, behavioural syndrome researchers have considerable theory and a wide range of tools already available to them.

Personality can and does change: at any given age or life stage it is contingent upon a wide range of experiential factors that occurred earlier in life, from prior to conception through adulthood. We show how developmental reaction norms that describe the effects of prior experience on a given behaviour can be used to determine whether the effects of a given experience at a given age will affect contextual generality at a later age, and to illustrate how variation within individuals in developmental plasticity leads to variation in contextual generality across individuals as a function of experience. We also show why niche-picking and niche-construction, behavioural processes which allow individuals to affect their own developmental environment, can affect the contextual generality and the temporal consistency of personality. We conclude by discussing how an appreciation of developmental processes can alert behavioural ecologists studying animal personality to critical, untested assumptions that underlie their own research programmes, and outline situations in which a developmental perspective can improve studies of the functional significance and evolution of animal personality.",developmental reaction norms can be used to determine effects of prior experience at a given age can affect behavior at a later age,,,,review/methods,,appreciation of developmental processes can be importnt and suggest using developmental reaction norms,maybe,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

A constraint should not be understood as an absolute obstacle to evolution, as it may also generate new possibilities for evolutionary change. Modularity is, in this context, an important way of organizing biological information and has been recognized as a central concept in evolutionary biology bridging on developmental, genetics, morphological, biochemical, and physiological studies. In this article, we explore how modularity affects the evolution of a complex system in two mammalian lineages by analyzing correlation, variance/covariance, and residual matrices (without size variation). We use the multivariate response to selection equation to simulate the behavior of Eutheria and Metharia skulls in terms of their evolutionary flexibility and constraints. We relate these results to classical approaches based on morphological integration tests based on functional/developmental hypotheses. Eutherians (Neotropical primates) showed smaller magnitudes of integration compared with Metatheria (didelphids) and also skull modules more clearly delimited. Didelphids showed higher magnitudes of integration and their modularity is strongly influenced by within-groups size variation to a degree that evolutionary responses are basically aligned with size variation. Primates still have a good portion of the total variation based on size; however, their enhanced modularization allows a broader spectrum of responses, more similar to the selection gradients applied (enhanced flexibility). Without size variation, both groups become much more similar in terms of modularity patterns and magnitudes and, consequently, in their evolutionary flexibility. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev.

To evolve, sociality must have some heritable basis, yet the heritability of social relationships is largely unknown. Recent advances in both social network analyses and quantitative genetics allow us to quantify attributes of social relationships and estimate their heritability in free-living populations. Our analyses addressed a variety of measures (in-degree, out-degree, attractiveness, expansiveness, embeddedness, and betweenness), and we hypothesized that traits reflecting relationships controlled by an individual (i.e., those that the individual initiated or were directly involved in) would be more heritable than those based largely on the behavior of conspecifics. Identifying patterns of heritability and selection among related traits may provide insight into which types of relationships are important in animal societies. As expected, we found that variation in indirect measures was largely explained by nongenetic variation. Yet, surprisingly, traits capturing initiated interactions do not possess significant additive genetic variation, whereas measures of received interactions are heritable. Measures describing initiated aggression and position in an agonistic network are under selection (0.3 < vertical bar S vertical bar < 0.4), although advantageous trait values are not inherited by offspring. It appears that agonistic relationships positively influence fitness and seemingly costly or harmful ties may, in fact, be beneficial. Our study highlights the importance of studying agonistic as well as affiliative relationships to understand fully the connections between sociality and fitness.",analysis of heritability of social networks revealed a surprising heritability of receiving interactions and a positive effect of agonistic interacctions,Marmota flaviventris,yellow-bellied marmots,Mammalia,social networks analysis in free-living population,pedigree,interesting interdicsiplinary example,yes,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,not human

A century and half ago, Darwin developed the theory of natural selection, and proposed it as the main mechanism of evolution. A quantitative approach to the study of evolution required new theoretical developments in population and quantitative genetics. Here, I review the basic concepts of quantitative genetics neccessary to understand microevolutionary change. Natural selection is a consequence of differences in fitness (reproductive success) between individuals in a population. But natural selection is not equal to evolution. In order to achieve evolutionary, change, variation in fitness must be heritable, i.e. it must be transmited by genes from parents to offspring. Besides fitness differences, individuals within a population often differ in many other characters (morphological, physiological and behavioural) which are also genetically transmited from generation to generation. It is crucial to distinguish the process of selection which operates in an existing generation from the evolutionary change which is visible in the next generation. Most concepts of quantitative genetics centre around variances and covariances, and include the evolutionary potential of a population or heritability (ratio of additive genetic variance and phenotypic variance), the strength of selection on a particular trait (covariance of particular trait and fitness), the total strength of selection (phenotypic variance in fitness) and evolutionary response (phenotypic change in the next generation) which can be predicted by breeder's equation.",review of basic concepts of quantitative genetics,,,,review,,only read if I want an overview of quantitative genetics,maybe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

A further objective in the study was to observe whether genetic association with a number of candidate markers reflects results from the quantitative genetic analysis.   Method: We have studied 312 twin pairs at two time-points, age 2 and age 3. A composite measure of ADHD symptoms from two parent-rating scales: The Child Behavior Checklist/1.5-5 years (CBCL) hyperactivity scale and the Revised Rutter Parent Scale for Preschool Children (RRPSPC) was used for both quantitative and molecular genetic analyses.   Results: At ages 2 and 3 ADHD symptoms are highly heritable (h(2) = 0.79 and 0.78, respectively) with a high level of genetic stability across these ages. However, we also observe a significant level of genetic change from age 2 to age 3. There are modest influences of non-shared environment at each age independently (e(2) = 0.22 and 0.21, respectively), with these influences being largely age-specific. In addition, we find modest association signals in DAT1 and NET1 at both ages, along with suggestive specific effects of 5-HTT and DRD4 at age 3.   Conclusions: ADHD symptoms are heritable at ages 2 and 3. Additive genetic variance is largely shared across these ages, although there are significant new effects emerging at age 3.

This understanding is complicated by the fact that organisms need to work well in multiple environments, with both predictable and unpredictable environmental perturbations. Furthermore, organismal design reflects a history of past environments and not a plan for future environments. How complex, interacting functional systems evolve, then, is a truly grand challenge. In accepting the challenge, an integrative model of evolutionary covariance is developed. The model combines quantitative genetics, functional morphology/physiology, and functional ecology. The model is used to convene scientists ranging from geneticists, to physiologists, to ecologists, to engineers to facilitate the emergence of body shape in fishes as a model system for understanding how complex, interacting functional systems develop and evolve. Body shape of fish is a complex morphology that (1) results from many developmental paths and (2) functions in many different behaviors. Understanding the coordination and evolution of the many paths from genes to body shape, body shape to function, and function to a working fish body in a dynamic environment is now possible given new technologies from genetics to engineering and new theoretical models that integrate the different levels of biological organization (from genes to ecology).",not quantitative genetics,fish,fish,fish,model,,this is a model describing how body shape results from many developmental paths and functions in many different behaviors,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance (ANOVA)-based and linear mixed-effects model (LMM)-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of LMM- and GLMM-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.",statistical methods for evaluating repeatability,,,,stats method,,not particcularly useful for the chapter - advocate LMM and GLMM based approaches,probably not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

 J, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES," Evans, JPAF Evans, Jonathan P.", Quantitative genetic evidence that males trade attractiveness for   ejaculate quality in guppies,277,2010," Polyandry, where females mate with multiple males, means that a male's reproductive success will depend both on his ability to acquire mates and the ability of his sperm to compete effectively for fertilizations. But, how do males partition their reproductive investment between these two episodes of selection? Theory predicts that increases in ejaculate investment will come at a cost to investment in other reproductive traits. Although evidence revealing such trade-offs is accumulating, we know little about their genetic basis. Here, I report patterns of genetic (co) variation for a range of traits subject to pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection in the guppy Poecilia reticulata, a promiscuous livebearing fish in which males alternate between courtship and sneak matings to obtain copulations. The analyses of genetic variation and covariation for these behaviours revealed a strong genetic predisposition for one tactic over the other. Both mating tactics were also strongly genetically integrated with the level of sexual ornamentation and ejaculate quality. Males that predominantly performed sneak matings were less ornamented but had faster swimming sperm than those that predominantly used courtship. These patterns of genetic variation and covariation reveal potential evolutionary constraints on the direction of selection of pre- and post-copulatory traits, and support sperm competition theory by revealing a trade-off between sexual attractiveness and investment in ejaculates.",genetic variation and covariation for pre adn post ccopulatory traits reveals a strong genetic predicsposition for one tacctic over the other. ,Poecilia reticulata,Trinidadian guppies,Actinopterygii,analysis of genetic covariation,half-sib,sneaking and courting were strongly genetically integrated with sexual ornamentation and ejaculate quality.

They have, however, unique characteristics that set them apart from physiological and morphological quantitative traits. First, behaviours are the ultimate expression of the nervous system. This means that understanding the genetic underpinnings of behaviours requires a neurobiological context, i.e. an understanding of the genes-brain-behaviour axis. In other words, how do ensembles of genes empower specific neural circuits to drive behaviours? Second, behaviours represent the interface between an organism and its environment. Thus, environmental effects are likely to make substantial contributions to determining behavioural outputs and genotype-by-environment interactions are expected to be prominent. It is important to differentiate between genes that contribute to the manifestation of the behavioural phenotype and genes that contribute to phenotypic variation in behaviour. The former are identified by classical mutagenesis experiments, whereas the latter can be detected through quantitative genetic approaches. Genes that contribute to phenotypic variation in behaviour harbour polymorphisms that provide the substrates for evolution.

Parallel to this work is a growing body of evidence from genetically informed studies indicating that social environmental factors are central to enhancing or offsetting genetic influences. Increased precision in the understanding of the role of the social environment in offsetting genetic risk might provide new information about environmental mechanisms that could be applied to prevention science. However, at present, the multifaceted conceptualization of the environment in prevention science is mismatched with the more limited measurement of the environment in many genetically informed studies. In this article, we present a framework for translating quantitative behavioral genetic research to inform the development of preventive interventions. The measurement of environmental indices amenable to modification is discussed within the context of quantitative behavioral genetic studies. In particular, emphasis is placed on the necessary elements that lead to benefits in prevention science, specifically the development of evidence-based interventions. We provide an example from an ongoing prospective adoption study to illustrate the potential of this translational process to inform the selection of preventive intervention targets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Tambs, K.", Family Matters: Happiness in Nuclear Families and Twins,40,2010," Biometric studies have shown that happiness is strongly affected by genes. The findings are mainly based on twin data, however, and the full validity of the results has been debated. To overcome some limitations in classical twin research, we examined aetiological sources of subjective well-being (SWB), using two independent population-based samples, one including nuclear families (N = 54,540) and one including twins (N = 6,620). Biometric modelling using R was conducted to test for a data structure implying either non-additive genetic effects or higher environmental co-twin correlation in MZ than DZ pairs (violation of the EEA). We also estimated non-random mating, cultural transmission and shared environments specific for regular siblings and twins. Two sets of nested models were fitted and compared. The best explanatory model shows that family matters for happiness predominantly due to quantitative sex-specific genetic effects, a moderate spousal correlation and a shared twin environment. Upper limits for broad-sense heritability were estimated to be 0.33 (females) and 0.36 (males). Our study constitutes the most elaborate biometric study of SWB to date and illustrates the utility of including responses from multiple types of relatives in quantitative genetic analyses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Potential benefits for females and the risk of cuckoldry for males are expected to have important implications on the evolution of parental care. However, whether parents adjust parental care in response to parentage remains unclear. In Eurasian penduline tits Remiz pendulinus, which are small polygamous songbirds, parental care is carried out either by the male or by the female. In addition, one third of clutches is deserted by both male and female. Desertion takes place during the egg-laying phase. Using genotypes of nine microsatellite loci of 443 offspring and 211 adults, we test whether extra-pair paternity predicts parental care. We expect males to be more likely to desert cuckolded broods, whereas we expect females, if they obtain benefits from having multiple sires, to be more likely to care for broods with multiple paternity. Our results suggest that parental care is not adjusted to parentage on an ecological timescale. Furthermore, we found that male attractiveness does not predict cuckoldry, and we found no evidence for indirect benefits for females (i.e., increased growth rates or heterozygosity of extra-pair offspring). We argue that male Eurasian penduline tits may not be able to assess the risk of cuckoldry; thus, a direct association with parental care is unlikely to evolve. However, timing of desertion (i.e., when to desert during the egg-laying phase) may be influenced by the risk of cuckoldry. Future work applying extensive gene sequencing and quantitative genetics is likely to further our understanding of how selection may influence the association between parentage and parental care.",not quantitative genetics,Remiz pendulinus,penduline tits,Aves,tested whether EPP predicts parental care,,parentl care is not adjusted to parentage - males may not be able to assess the risk of ccuckoldry. ,no,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Moreover, these adjustments may be fine tuned in response to risks of attack by natural enemies. Thus, we may predict that as an organism ages it will accept increasing levels of exposure to predators during mating activities, effectively trading the risk of losing terminal mating opportunities for the risk of predation. We tested this prediction in an acoustic moth, Achroia grisella, in which females orient toward and evaluate males based on their ultrasonic calling song, and both sexes may be vulnerable to predation by insectivorous bats while in flight as well as on the substrate. In the latter situation, singing males and orienting females show silence and arrestment responses, respectively, when presented with synthetic bat echolocation signals broadcast above a threshold amplitude. We found that both males and females become less sensitive to these broadcasts over the course of their brief reproductive periods, 7 and 5 days, respectively. Over the same periods, sensitivity to male song in both males and females remains constant, and relatively little senescence in sexual behavior is observed. These results support the risk trading hypothesis, and they indicate that life history principles may apply over a very short lifespan.",not quantitative genetics,Ahroi grisella,moth,Insecta,measured calling behaviors during mating in presence of predators ,,found tht as reproductive period progresses males and females become less sensitive to predator calls,no,,x,x,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,not human

However, most analyses of phenotypic evolution focus on single landmark ages. Here, we present an inheritance study that quantifies genetic variation in pigmentation across early-age (i.e., birth to 180 days) development in 2 populations of the common garter snake, Thamnophis sirtalis. The populations are phenotypically distinct and geographically isolated (Manitoba, CA and Northern California, USA). There were highly significant differences between populations for the developmental trajectory of mean pigmentation, with the Manitoba population exhibiting a mean pigmentation level that increased across ontogeny, whereas the California population exhibited mean pigmentation that was invariant across ontogeny. Subsequent quantitative genetic analyses revealed heritable variation at all ages in Manitoba but low levels of phenotypic and genetic variation in California at all ages. A quantitative genetic decomposition of the longitudinal genetic variance-covariance matrix for the age-specific pigmentation phenotypes in the Manitoba population revealed 2 primary orthogonal axes that explained most (similar to 100%) of the pigmentation variation across ontogeny. The primary axis, explaining 93% of the genetic variation, is an axis of genetic variation whose principal value loadings change from positive to negative across development, suggesting that the most rapid evolutionary response to selection on pigmentation variation will occur in the direction characterized by a tradeoff in early-age versus late-age pigmentation phenotypes. Pigmentation is known to be ecologically important and subject to rapid evolution under selection. Our study shows that significant differences exist between these 2 populations for their capacity to respond to selection on pigmentation which is not only influenced by the population of origin but also by the developmental process. We suggest that developmental timing may be a potential explanatory mechanism for the difference between the populations.",not behavior,Thamnophis sirtalis,garter snake,Reptilia,quantitative genetics analysis,,focus on pigmentation not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Studies in children demonstrate that AT is an important risk factor for the later development of anxiety disorders, depression and comorbid substance abuse(5). Despite its importance as an early predictor of psychopathology, little is known about the factors that predispose vulnerable children to develop AT and the brain systems that underlie its expression. To characterize the neural circuitry associated with AT and the extent to which the function of this circuit is heritable, we studied a large sample of rhesus monkeys phenotyped for AT. Using 238 young monkeys from a multigenerational single-family pedigree, we simultaneously assessed brain metabolic activity and AT while monkeys were exposed to the relevant ethological condition that elicits the phenotype. High-resolution (18)F-labelled deoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) was selected as the imaging modality because it provides semi-quantitative indices of absolute glucose metabolic rate, allows for simultaneous measurement of behaviour and brain activity, and has a time course suited for assessing temperament-associated sustained brain responses. Here we demonstrate that the central nucleus region of the amygdala and the anterior hippocampus are key components of the neural circuit predictive of AT. We also show significant heritability of the AT phenotype by using quantitative genetic analysis. Additionally, using voxelwise analyses, we reveal significant heritability of metabolic activity in AT-associated hippocampal regions. However, activity in the amygdala region predictive of AT is not significantly heritable. Furthermore, the heritabilities of the hippocampal and amygdala regions significantly differ from each other. Even though these structures are closely linked, the results suggest differential influences of genes and environment on how these brain regions mediate AT and the ongoing risk of developing anxiety and depression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Yet few estimates of additive genetic variance and heritability are available for wild populations, particularly so for fishes. Here, we estimate heritability of length-at-age for wild-living brown trout (Salmo trutta), based on long-term mark-recapture data and pedigree reconstruction based on large-scale genotyping at 15 microsatellite loci. We also tested for the presence of maternal and paternal effects using a Bayesian version of the Animal model. Heritability varied between 0.16 and 0.31, with reasonable narrow confidence bands, and the total phenotypic variance increased with age. When introducing dam as an additional random effect (accounting for c. 7% of total phenotypic variance), the level of additive genetic variance and heritability decreased (0.12-0.21). Parental size (both for sires and for dams) positively influenced length-at-age for juvenile trout - either through direct parental effects or through genotype-environment correlations. Length-at-age is a complex trait reflecting the effects of a number of physiological, behavioural and ecological processes.

 J, LEARNING AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES," Thompson, LA   Oehlert, JAF Thompson, Lee Anne   Oehlert, Jeremy", The etiology of giftedness,20,2010," Many theories of giftedness either explicitly or implicitly acknowledge the role of genetic influences; yet, empirical work has not been able to establish the impact that genes have specifically on gifted behavior. In contrast, a great deal of research has been targeted at understanding the etiology of individual differences in general and specific cognitive abilities across the entire range of ability and to a lesser extent, high cognitive ability. This paper attempts to outline what we know and what we don't know about the etiology of giftedness as operationally defined as high g. We review studies selected to represent a variety of approaches that each address a different question about genetics and giftedness. These studies include quantitative genetic research which estimate heritability, shared and nonshared family environment - at the high and low ends of intelligence - as well as the heritability of group differences for general cognitive ability and specific cognitive abilities. We discuss the molecular genetic methods and mechanisms contributing to cognitive ability and suggest how epigenetic factors may operate. Quantitative and molecular genetic studies that include endophenotypes representing intelligence at a level closer to the genotype, are also included. This last group of studies represent a relatively new area of work that builds on and extends the extensive groundwork established by classic quantitative genetic studies of behavior.

The influence of both genes and environment on lung function, smoking behaviour and the presence of respiratory symptoms has previously been demonstrated for each of these separately. Hence, smoking can influence lung function by co-varying not only as an environmental factor, but also by shared genetic pathways. Therefore, the objective was to evaluate heritability for different aspects of lung function, and to investigate how the estimates are affected by adjustments for smoking and respiratory symptoms.   Methods: The current study is based on a selected sample of adult twins from the Swedish Twin Registry. Pairs were selected based on background data on smoking and respiratory symptoms collected by telephone interview. Lung function was measured as FEV(1), VC and DLco. Pack years were quantified, and quantitative genetic analysis was performed on lung function data adjusting stepwise for sex, pack years and respiratory symptoms.   Results: Fully adjusted heritability for VC was 59% and did not differ by sex, with smoking and symptoms explaining only a small part of the total variance. Heritabilities for FEV1 and DLco were sex specific. Fully adjusted estimates were 10 and 15% in men and 46% and 39% in women, respectively. Adjustment for smoking and respiratory symptoms altered the estimates differently in men and women. For FEV1 and DLco, the variance explained by smoking and symptoms was larger in men. Further, smoking and symptoms explained genetic variance in women, but was primarily associated with shared environmental effects in men.   Conclusion: Differences between men and women were found in how smoking and symptoms influence the variation in lung function. Pulmonary gas transfer variation related to the menstrual cycle has been shown before, and the findings regarding DLco in the present study indicates gender specific environmental susceptibility not shown before. As a consequence the results suggest that patients with lung diseases such as COPD could benefit from interventions that are sex specific.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

In a recent genome-wide association study of mathematical ability in 10-year-old children, 43 SNP associations were nominated from scans of pooled DNA, 10 of which were validated in an individually genotyped sample. The 4927 children in this genotyped sample have also been studied at 7, 9 and 12 years of age on measures of mathematical ability, as well as on other cognitive and learning abilities.   Results: Using these data we have explored the Generalist Genes Hypothesis by assessing the association of the available measures of ability at age 10 and other ages with two composite 'SNP-set' scores, formed from the full set of 43 nominated SNPs and the sub-set of 10 SNPs that were previously found to be associated with mathematical ability at age 10. Both SNP sets yielded significant associations with mathematical ability at ages 7, 9 and 12, as well as with reading and general cognitive ability at age 10.   Conclusions: Although effect sizes are small, our results correspond with those of quantitative genetic research in supporting the Generalist Genes Hypothesis. SNP sets identified on the basis of their associations with mathematical ability at age 10 show associations with mathematical ability at earlier and later ages and show associations of similar magnitude with reading and general cognitive ability. With small effect sizes expected in such complex traits, future studies may be able to capitalise on power by searching for 'generalist genes' using longitudinal and multivariate approaches.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

This might be due either to a global shift in the population mean of underlying contributing traits, or to increased variance of such underlying endophenotypes (such as body weight). To contrast these quantitative genetic mechanisms with respect to weight gain, we have quantified the effect of dietary perturbation on metabolic traits in 146 inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster and show that genotype-by-diet interactions are pervasive. For several metabolic traits, genotype-by-diet interactions account for far more variance (between 12 and 17%) than diet alone (1-2%), and in some cases have as large an effect as genetics alone (11-23%). Substantial dew point effects were also observed. Larval foraging behavior was found to be a quantitative trait exhibiting significant genetic variation for path length (P - 0.0004).Metabolic and fitness traits exhibited a complex correlation structure, and there was evidence of selection minimizing weight under laboratory conditions. In addition, a high fat diet significantly increases population variance in metabolic phenotypes, suggesting decreased robustness in the face of dietary perturbation.

Hlusko, Leslea J.", Genetic Integration of Molar Cusp Size Variation in Baboons,142,2010," Many studies of primate diversity and evolution rely on dental morphology for insight into diet, behavior, and phylogenetic relationships. Consequently, variation in molar cusp size has increasingly become a phenotype of interest. In 2007 we published a quantitative genetic analysis of mandibular molar cusp size variation in baboons. Those results provided more questions than answers, as the pattern of genetic integration did not fit predictions from odontogenesis. To follow up, we expanded our study to include data from the maxillary molar cusps. Here we report on these later analyses, as well as inter-arch comparisons with the mandibular data. We analyzed variation in two-dimensional maxillary molar cusp size using data collected from a captive pedigreed breeding colony of baboons, Papio hamadryas, housed at the Southwest National Primate Research Center. These analyses show that variation in maxillary molar cusp size is heritable and sexually dimorphic. We also estimated additive genetic correlations between cusps on the same crown, homologous cusps along the tooth row, and maxillary and mandibular cusps. The pattern for maxillary molars yields genetic correlations of one between the paracone metacone and protocone hypocone. Bivariate analyses of cuspal homologues on adjacent teeth yield correlations that are high or not significantly different from one. Between dental arcades, the nonoccluding cusps consistently yield high genetic correlations, especially the metaconid paracone and metaconid metacone. This pattern of genetic correlation does not immediately accord with the pattern of development and/or calcification, however these results do follow predictions that can be made from the evolutionary history of the tribosphenic molar.

Improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of crop plants is thus of key importance. NUE definitions differ depending on whether plants are cultivated to produce biomass or grain yields. However, for most plant species, NUE mainly depends on how plants extract inorganic nitrogen from the soil, assimilate nitrate and ammonium, and recycle organic nitrogen. Efforts have been made to study the genetic basis as well as the biochemical and enzymatic mechanisms involved in nitrogen uptake, assimilation, and remobilization in crops and model plants. The detection of the limiting factors that could be manipulated to increase NUE is the major goal of such research.

Previous work has reported that male guppies are more colorful in low-predation sites than in high-predation sites. This pattern of phenotypic variation has been theorized to reflect differences in the balance between natural (viability) selection that disfavors bright male color (owing to predation) and sexual selection that favors bright color (owing to female choice). Our results support the prediction that male color is disfavored by viability selection in both predation regimes. However, it does not support the prediction that viability selection against male color is weaker in low-predation experiments. Instead, some of the most intense bouts of selection against color occurred in low-predation experiments. Our results illustrate considerable spatiotemporal variation in selection among experiments, but such variation was not generally correlated with local patterns of color diversity. More complex selective interactions, possibly including the indirect effects of predators on variation in mating behavior, as well as other environmental factors, might be required to more fully explain patterns of secondary sexual trait variation in this system.",not quantitative genetics,Poecilia reticulata,Trinidadian guppies,Actinopterygii,mark recapture experiments,,male color is disfavored by viability selection in both low and high predation sites but viability selection is not weaker in low predation experiments. ,no,,x,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Objective: The objective was to investigate the heritability in early infancy of 4 appetitive traits that have been shown to be heritable later in childhood.   Design: Data are from the Gemini Study, a population-based sample of twins (n = 2402 pairs) born in England and Wales in 2007. To describe their children's eating behavior during the first 3 mo of life while they were still exclusively milk fed, the parents of the twins completed 4 subscales of the Baby Eating Behavior Questionnaire: ""enjoyment of food,"" ""food responsiveness,"" ""slowness in eating,"" and ""satiety responsiveness. ""Heritability was estimated by using quantitative genetic model fitting.   Results: Heritability was high for slowness in eating (84%; 95% CI: 83%, 86%) and satiety responsiveness (72%; 95% CI: 65%, 80%) and moderate for food responsiveness (59%; 95% CI: 52%, 65%) and enjoyment of food (53%; 95% CI: 43%, 63%).   Conclusions: Genetically determined variability in appetitive traits may be one of the pathways through which genes influence the growth rate in infancy.

P.", Genetics of Learning Abilities and Disabilities: Recent Developments   from the UK and Possible Directions for Research in China,40,2010," It is exciting to witness the birth of behavioral genetics in China at a time when the field of genetics is exploding with new discoveries. We begin by discussing the potential for Chinese researchers to sidestep the false starts of previous genetic research on behavior and to become leaders rather than followers in behavioral genetics research. Using learning abilities and disabilities as an example, the rest of the paper considers ways in which quantitative genetic research can go beyond the nature versus nurture question to ask more interesting questions about genetics and psychology. These include the relationship between the normal and abnormal, longitudinal analyses of stability and change, and multivariate analyses of heterogeneity and homogeneity. The most important way to go beyond the rudimentary question about nature versus nurture is to identify the genes responsible for genetic influence on behavior. We briefly describe our quantitative genetic findings and genome-wide association studies of learning ability from the UK Twins Early Development Study (TEDS). It seems a safe prediction that the fast pace of genetic discoveries will continue and will increasingly affect the field of psychology in China and the rest of the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human
 J, EVOLUTION," Devaux, C   Lande, RAF Devaux, Celine   Lande, Russell", SELECTION ON VARIANCE IN FLOWERING TIME WITHIN AND AMONG INDIVIDUALS,64,2010," We model the impact of pollinator visitation rate and behavior on the short-term evolution of population flowering phenologies determined by the distributions of flowering times within and among individual plants. Evolution of population flowering phenologies depends on the phenotypic variances and heritabilities of the within-individual mean and variance of flowering time. In the ecological scenarios we investigate selection does not produce a correlation of the mean and variance of individual flowering time. Self-incompatibility causes weak stabilizing selection on flowering time that acts to reduce the within-individual variance in flowering time. Disruptive selection due to pollinator limitation acts mostly to increase the among-individual variance in flowering time. Stabilizing selection due to pollinator attraction, or short reproductive season, acts mostly to decrease the within-individual variance in flowering time. Temporal autocorrelation of environmental stochasticity in pollinator visitation rate strongly selects to increase the within-individual variance in flowering time. These predictions can be tested by measuring the causal factors described above, partitioning the variance in population phenology within and among individuals, and estimating the inheritance of, and selection on, within-individual mean and variance of flowering time.",plants,,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

A.", Heritability of anti-predatory traits: vigilance and locomotor   performance in marmots,23,2010," Animals must allocate some proportion of their time to detecting predators. In birds and mammals, such anti-predator vigilance has been well studied, and we know that it may be influenced by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Despite hundreds of studies focusing on vigilance and suggestions that there are individual differences in vigilance, there have been no prior studies examining its heritability in the field. Here, we present one of the first reports of (additive) genetic variation in vigilance. Using a restricted maximum likelihood procedure, we found that, in yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris), the heritability of locomotor ability (h2 = 0.21), and especially vigilance (h2 = 0.08), is low. These modest heritability estimates suggest great environmental variation or a history of directional selection eliminating genetic variation in these traits. We also found a significant phenotypic (r(P) = -0.09 +/- 0.04, P = 0.024) and a substantial, but not significant, genetic correlation (r(A) = -0.57 +/- 0.28, P = 0.082) between the two traits (slower animals are less vigilant while foraging). We found no evidence of differential survival or longevity associated with particular phenotypes of either trait. The genetic correlation may persist because of environmental heterogeneity and genotype-by-environment interactions maintaining the correlation, or because there are two ways to solve the problem of foraging in exposed areas: be very vigilant and rely on early detection coupled with speed to escape, or reduce vigilance to minimize time spent in an exposed location. Both strategies seem to be equally successful, and this 'locomotor ability-wariness' syndrome may therefore allow slow animals to compensate behaviourally for their impaired locomotor ability.",additive genetic varince in  wild population for antipredator vigilance,Marmota flaviventris,yellow-bellied marmots,Mammalia,REML,relatedness,locomotor ability and vigilance have low heritabilities suggesting lots of genetic variation.

 J, PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES," Mackay, TFCAF Mackay, Trudy F. C.", Mutations and quantitative genetic variation: lessons from Drosophila,365,2010," A central issue in evolutionary quantitative genetics is to understand how genetic variation for quantitative traits is maintained in natural populations. Estimates of genetic variation and of genetic correlations and pleiotropy among multiple traits, inbreeding depression, mutation rates for fitness and quantitative traits and of the strength and nature of selection are all required to evaluate theoretical models of the maintenance of genetic variation. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have shown that a substantial fraction of segregating variation for fitness-related traits in Drosophila is due to rare deleterious alleles maintained by mutation-selection balance, with a smaller but significant fraction attributable to intermediate frequency alleles maintained by alleles with antagonistic pleiotropic effects, and late-age-specific effects. However, the nature of segregating variation for traits under stabilizing selection is less clear and requires more detailed knowledge of the loci, mutation rates, allelic effects and frequencies of molecular polymorphisms affecting variation in suites of pleiotropically connected traits. Recent studies in D. melanogaster have revealed unexpectedly complex genetic architectures of many quantitative traits, with large numbers of pleiotropic genes and alleles with sex-, environment-and genetic background-specific effects. Future genome wide association analyses of many quantitative traits on a common panel of fully sequenced Drosophila strains will provide much needed empirical data on the molecular genetic basis of quantitative traits.",not relevant,Drosophila melanogaster,fruit fly,Insecta,review,,"focus on difference between stabilizing and directional selection, but ot really a focus on behavior - but could be useful to skim for genetic arcchitectures of behavioral traits",probably not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

For example, the relative importance of heritable variation versus shared early environment effects ( like sexual imprinting) on mating preferences has never been quantified in a population of animals. Here, we estimate the heritability of and early rearing effects on mate choice decisions in zebra finches based on the similarity of choices between pairs of genetic sisters raised apart and pairs of unrelated foster sisters. We found a low and nonsignificant heritability of preferences and no significant shared early rearing effects. A literature review shows that a low heritability of preferences is rather typical, whereas empirical tests for the relevance of sexual imprinting within populations are currently limited to very few studies. Although effects on preference functions (i.e., which male to prefer) were weak, we found strong individual consistency in choice behavior and part of this variation was heritable. It seems likely that variation in choice behavior (choosiness, responsiveness, sampling behavior) would produce patterns of nonrandom mating and this might be the more important source of between-individual differences in mating patterns.",estimate heritability and rearing effects on mate choice decisions,Taeniopygia guttata,zebra finch,Aves,sisters raised apart and pairs of unrelated foster sisters,pedigree,low and nonsignificant heritability of preferences and no significant early rearing effects - strong individual consistency,probably not,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Developmental origins of ADHD represent an interesting area of research to understand the genetics that underlie early appearing individual differences. However, understanding the molecular basis of ADHD requires accurate, unbiased, heritable measures that can be used for molecular genetic association analyses. We take two approaches to examine the genetics of ADHD behaviours in infancy. Using quantitative genetic techniques, we explore the relationship between objective measures of activity level (AL) in both home and laboratory environments as well as with parent ratings of ADHD symptoms in a population sample of 2-year-old twins. Molecular association analyses of these measures examine candidate genes previously associated with ADHD. We find that ADHD symptoms, AL in the home and AL in the lab represent heritable phenotypes in 2-year-old infants. AL measured in the home has a strong genetic correlation with symptoms of ADHD, whereas AL in the lab correlates only modestly with the same ADHD measure. Genetic correlations suggest that AL in the home is more comparable than AL in the lab to ADHD behaviour and support the separation of all three for molecular analyses. There was modest evidence for association between DAT1, NET1 and ADHD symptom scores, as well as between DAT1 and AL in the lab.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

During an 8-year field study in the Bahamas, we examined selective mortality on size and growth throughout the entire reef-associated life phase of a common coral-reef fish, Stegastes partitus (the bicolour damselfish). On average, faster-growing juveniles experienced greater mortality, though as adults, larger individuals had higher survival. Comparing patterns of selection observed at four separate populations revealed that greater population density was associated with stronger selection for larger adult size. Large adults may be favoured because they are superior competitors and less susceptible to gape-limited predators. Laboratory experiments suggested that selective mortality of fast-growing juveniles was likely because of risk-prone foraging behaviour. These patterns suggest that variation in ecological interactions may lead to complex patterns of lifetime selection on body size.",not behavior,Stegastes prtitus,bicolour damselfish,Actinopterygii,mortality on size and growth evaluated over multiple years,,focused on size and growth and selective mortality,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Here we show how prenatal effects on offspring begging can link the two different approaches. Using theoretical and experimental analyses, we show that when offspring control provisioning, prenatal effects primarily serve the parent's interests: Selection on parents drives coadaptation of parent and offspring traits. In contrast, when parents control provisioning, prenatal effects primarily serve the offspring's interests: Selection on the offspring drives coadaptation of parent and offspring traits.

Although its etiology is relatively poorly understood, quantitative genetic research has demonstrated mathematical ability to be moderately heritable. In this first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of mathematical ability and disability, 10 out of 43 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations nominated from two high- vs. low-ability (n = 600 10-year-olds each) scans of pooled DNA were validated (P < 0.05) in an individually genotyped sample of *2356 individuals spanning the entire distribution of mathematical ability, as assessed by teacher reports and online tests. Although the effects are of the modest sizes now expected for complex traits and require further replication, interesting candidate genes are implicated such as NRCAM which encodes a neuronal cell adhesion molecule. When combined into a set, the 10 SNPs account for 2.9% (F = 56.85; df = 1 and 1881; P = 7.277e-14) of the phenotypic variance. The association is linear across the distribution consistent with a quantitative trait locus (QTL) hypothesis; the third of children in our sample who harbour 10 or more of the 20 risk alleles identified are nearly twice as likely (OR = 1.96; df = 1; P = 3.696e-07) to be in the lowest performing 15% of the distribution.

Transcription regulation of vtg by E-2 is dependent on binding of the ligand (E-2) to a specific nuclear receptor (estrogen receptor, ESR) which in turn binds to an estrogen responsive element (ERE) in the promoter of vtg. Since a local tilapiine. Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters), is targeted as a model for estrogenic endocrine disruption in Southern Africa, a platform of knowledge is necessary for the ontogenic and tissue specific behavior of ESR in this species before vtg levels can be interpreted in relation to such endocrine disruption. Therefore, three ESR cDNA sequences (ESR I, ESR2a and ESR2b) in O. mossambicus were isolated and QPCR protocols were developed to ascertain their quantitative transcript levels in adult brain, gonadal and hepatic tissues. ESR1 transcript levels were highest in female liver tissue compared to males and other tissues, whereas the levels for ESR2a and b were not statistically significantly different between male and female tissues. Quantitative gene levels during development demonstrated a sharp increase in ESR1 during the stage of gonad differentiation (50-60 days post-fertilization) in this species. Finally, an induction experiment in adult male liver tissue confirms the upregulation of ESR1 by E-2. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Individuals that grow fast may avoid this tradeoff and switch habitats at both a larger size and younger age. A fast growth rate itself can be costly, however, as it requires greater resource intake. For parasites, fast larval growth is assumed to increase the likelihood of host death before transmission to the next host occurs. Using the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus in its copepod first intermediate host, I investigated potential constraints in the parasite's larval life history. Fast-growing parasites developed infectivity earlier, indicating there is no functional tradeoff between size and developmental time. There was significant growth variation among full-sib worm families, but fast-growing sibships were not characterized by lower host survival or more predation-risky host behavior. Parental investment also had little effect on larval growth rates. The commonly assumed constraints on larval growth and development were not observed in this system, so it remains unclear what prevents worms from exploiting their intermediate hosts more aggressively.",not behavior,Schistocephalus solidus,tapeworm,Cestoda,full-sib experiments,,focused on larval growth rates,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

We detail the shortcomings of current methods aimed at describing variation in behavioural syndromes, such as multiple pairwise correlations and principal components analysis (PCA). In their place we propose an alternative statistical framework involving: (1) calculation of trait variance-covariance and correlation matrices within each data set; (2) statistical evaluation of specific hypotheses regarding how behaviours covary within a behavioural syndrome; and (3) statistical comparison of behavioural covariances across data sets using structural equation modelling (SEM). Given their unfamiliarity to most behavioural ecologists, we illustrate these methods using an already published data set for two groups of populations of three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, living in ponds with and without fish predators. Previous analyses suggested a lack of behavioural syndrome structure for stickleback that lived in the absence of fish predators. However, by evaluating a priori hypotheses of how behaviours might covary using SEM, we were able to demonstrate that the two types of populations differed specifically in covariance patterns for aggression, exploration of novel food sources and altered environments, but not for exploration of novel environments and activity. Such detailed inferences cannot readily be made based on conventional statistical approaches alone, and so the methods we outline here should become standard in studies concerning the evolution of behavioural syndromes within and between populations.

Quantitative geneticists often strive to partition Out all environmental variance to measure heritability. Behavioral biologists and ecologists however, require methods to integrate genetic and environmental components of inherited phenotypic variance in order to estimate the evolutionary potential of traits, which encompasses any form of information that is inherited. To help develop this integration, we build on the tools of quantitative genetics and offer the concept of 'inclusive heritability' which identifies and unifies the various mechanisms of information transmission across generations. A controversial component of non-genetic information is animal Culture, which is the part of phenotypic variance inherited through social learning. Culture has the unique property of being transmitted horizontally and obliquely, as well as vertically. Accounting for cultural variation Would allow us to examine a broader range of evolutionary mechanisms. Culture may, for instance, produce behavioral isolating mechanisms leading to speciation. To advance the study of animal culture, we offer a definition of culture that is rooted in quantitative genetics. We also offer four testable criteria to determine whether a trait is culturally inherited. These criteria may constitute a conceptual tool to study animal culture. We briefly discuss methods to partition out cultural variance. Several authors have recently called for 'modernizing the modern synthesis' by including non-genetic factors such as epigenetics and phenotypic plasticity in order to more fully explain phenotypic evolution. Here, we further propose to broaden the concept of inheritance by incorporating the cultural component of behavior.

Two models, the selfish gene theory and frozen plasticity theory were suggested to explain evolution of adaptive traits in sexual organisms in past 30 years.   Results: The frozen plasticity theory suggests that sexual species can evolve new adaptations only when their members are genetically uniform, i.e. only after a portion of the population of the original species had split off, balanced on the edge of extinction for several generations, and then undergone rapid expansion. After a short period of time, estimated on the basis of paleontological data to correspond to 1-2% of the duration of the species, polymorphism accumulates in the gene pool due to frequency-dependent selection; and thus, in each generation, new mutations occur in the presence of different alleles and therefore change their selection coefficients from generation to generation. The species ceases to behave in an evolutionarily plastic manner and becomes evolutionarily elastic on a microevolutionary time-scale and evolutionarily frozen on a macroevolutionary time-scale. It then exists in this state until such changes accumulate in the environment that the species becomes extinct.   Conclusion: Frozen plasticity theory, which includes the Darwinian model of evolution as a special case - the evolution of species in a plastic state, not only offers plenty of new predictions to be tested, but also provides explanations for a much broader spectrum of known biological phenomena than classic evolutionary theories.

The first two gaps should be kept open; the others should be bridged or the difficulty of doing so should be acknowledged: 1. Key terms have multiple meanings that are distinct; 2. Statistical patterns are distinct from measurable underlying factors; 3. Translation from statistical analyses to hypotheses about measurable factors is difficult; 4. Predictions based on extrapolations from existing patterns of variation may not match outcomes; 5. The partitioning of variation in human studies does not reliably estimate the intended quantities; 6. Translation from statistical analyses to hypotheses about the measurable factors is even more difficult in light of the possible heterogeneity of underlying genetic or environmental factors; 7. Many steps lie between the analysis of observed traits and interventions based on well-founded claims about the causal influence of genetic or environmental factors; 8. Explanation of variation within groups does not translate to explanation of differences among groups. At the start, I engage readers' attention with three puzzles that have not been resolved by past debates. The puzzles concern generational increases in IQ test scores, the possibility of underlying heterogeneity, and the translation of methods from selective breeding into human genetics. After discussing the gaps, I present each puzzle in a new light and point to several new puzzles that invite attention from analysts of variation in quantitative genetics and in social science more generally.

However, wecaution that the literature is probably littered with studies that have overemphasised the importance of some maternal effects and recent studies have highlighted analytical and logical flaws that have probably led to misplaced confidence in some of the findings reported to date.

Thus, cross-sex genetic covariance is assumed to play a key role in the evolution of sexual dimorphism (SD) with consequent impacts on sexual selection, population dynamics, and speciation processes. We compiled cross-sex genetic correlations (r(MF)) estimates from 114 sources to assess the extent to which the evolution of SD is typically constrained and test several specific hypotheses. First, we tested if r(MF) differed among trait types and especially between fitness components and other traits. We also tested the theoretical prediction of a negative relationship between r(MF) and SD based on the expectation that increases in SD should be facilitated by sex-specific genetic variance. We show that r(MF) is usually large and positive but that it is typically smaller for fitness components.

Sheldon, Ben C.", Heterogeneous selection on a heritable temperament trait in a variable   environment,78,2009," P> Temperament traits increasingly provide a focus for investigating the evolutionary ecology of behavioural variation. Here, we examine the underlying causes and selective consequences of individual variation in the temperament trait 'exploration behaviour in a novel environment' (EB, based on an 8-min assay) in a free-ranging population of a passerine bird, the great tit Parus major.   First, we conducted a quantitative genetic analysis on EB using a restricted maximum likelihood-based animal model with a long-term pedigree. Although repeatability was relatively high, EB was only moderately heritable and permanent environment (V(PE)) effects contributed as much to phenotypic variance as additive genetic effects.   We then asked whether heterogeneous selection acted on EB at various temporal and spatial scales. Using estimates of lifetime reproductive success, we found evidence of weak negative directional selection acting on EB amongst females which was driven by selection through recruitment, but not fecundity, in one of the four breeding years. There was no evidence of any selection on EB through survival.   Heterogeneous selection on EB within seasons was also observed amongst males through fecundity along two fine-scale environmental gradients - local breeding density and habitat quality; we are unaware of any previous equivalent demonstrations.   All of these analyses were repeated on a second measure of exploration behaviour (EB(2), measured during a 2-min assay) to facilitate comparison with other studies. EB and EB(2) were strongly correlated to one another at the genetic level, but were only moderately correlated at the phenotypic level and V(PE) was undetected in EB(2). Selection on EB(2) was similar to that on EB; we conclude that both traits are broadly equivalent from an evolutionary perspective.   Our analyses suggest that to the extent that the temperament trait 'exploration behaviour' is subject to natural selection in this population, this selection is highly context dependent and most evident along two environmental gradients. Furthermore, the strong V(PE) effect detected suggests that understanding the causes and consequences of variation in this trait will require studies firmly embedded in an environmental context.",explortory behavior was moderately heritble and permanent environment effects contributed as much to phenotypic varince as additive genetic effects. ,Parus major,great tits,Aves,quantitative genetic nalysis using REML animal model with a long-term pedigree,pedigree,environment also plays a role in temperament behavior,probably not,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Culturing of chondrocytes under low oxygen tension has shown several advantages, among them increased synthesis of extracellular matrix and increased redifferentiation of dedifferentiated chondrocytes. Quantitative gene expression analyses such as quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) are powerful tools in the investigation of underlying mechanisms of cell behavior and are used routinely for differentiation and phenotype assays. However, the genes used for normalization in normoxic cell-cultures might not be suitable in the hypoxic environment. The objective of this study was to determine hypoxia-stable housekeeping genes (HKG) for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in human chondrocytes cultured in 21%, 5% and 1% oxygen by geNorm and NormFinder analyses.   Results: The chondrocytic response to the hypoxic challange was validated by a significant increase in expression of the hypoxia-inducible gene ankyrin repeat 37 as well as SOX9 in hypoxia. When cultured on the 3-dimentional (3D) scaffold TATA-binding protein (TBP) exhibited the highest expression stability with NormFinder while Ribosomal protein L13a (RPL13A) and beta2-microglobulin (B2M) were the most stable using geNorm analysis. In monolayer RPL13A were the most stable gene using NormFinder, while geNorm assessed RPL13A and human RNA polymerase II (RPII) as most stable. When examining the combination of (3D) culturing and monolayer RPL13A and B2M showed the highest expression stability from geNorm analysis while RPL13A also showed the highest expression stability using NormFinder. Often used HKG such as beta actin (ACTB) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were the most unstable genes investigated in all comparisons. The pairwise variations for the two most stable HKG in each group were all below the cut-off value of 0.15, suggesting that the two most stable HKG from geNorm analysis would be sufficient for qRT-PCR.   Conclusion: All data combined we recommend RPL13A, B2M and RPII as the best choice for qRT-PCR analyses when comparing normoxic and hypoxic cultured human chondrocytes although other genes might also be suitable. However, the matching of HKG to target genes by means of a thorough investigation of the stability in each study would always be preferable.",not relevant,,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Novel ecological stressors may limit adaptive evolution of naive lineages that have experienced historically different selective regimes. Regarded as recently derived from a pond-breeding ancestor, streamside salamanders face the novel and strong selection pressure of breeding in streams with fish predators. A statistical phylogenetic approach was used to test whether adaptive evolution of antipredator performance phenotypes in streamside salamanders was positively associated with: (1) estimated per-lineage duration of coexistence with predatory fish; and (2) consistency of this predator selective-regime within lineages. Average durations of fish contact were computed for each salamander lineage on a set of chronograms. Selection consistency was determined by estimating the number of ecological transitions between fish and fishless states using stochastic character mapping. Historical selection in streamside salamanders can be generally characterized as unstable, apparently punctuated by the stochastic loss and recolonization of predatory fish in most lineages.

To test the model we studied metabolic, behavioural and morphological correlates of replicated selection on maximum body mass-corrected metabolism elicited by swimming ((V)over dot(O2swim)) in male laboratory mice. While 10 generations of selection did not change body mass, it resulted in a 12% difference in (V)over dot(O2swim) between mice of selected and control line types and significant, correlated responses in maximum metabolic rates elicited by exposure to cold in a helium-oxygen atmosphere ((V)over dot(O2He)), and during forced running on a motorized treadmill ((V)over dot(O2run)).

Objective: To identify patterns of gene-environment interplay between externalizing disorders (antisocial behavior and substance use) and several environmental risk factors.   Design: We used quantitative genetic models to examine how genetic and environmental risk for externalizing disorders changes as a function of environmental context.   Setting: Participants were recruited from the community and took part in a daylong assessment at a university laboratory.   Participants: The sample consisted of 1315 male and female twin pairs participating in the assessment of the Minnesota Twin Family Study at age 17 years.   Main Outcome Measures: Multiple measures and informants were used to construct a composite of externalizing disorders and composite measures of 6 environmental risk factors, including academic achievement and engagement, antisocial and prosocial peer affiliations, mother-child and father-child relationship problems, and stressful life events.   Results: A significant gene X environment interaction was detected between each environmental risk factor and externalizing such that greater environmental adversity was associated with increased genetic risk for externalizing.   Conclusions: In the context of environmental adversity, genetic factors become more important in the etiology of externalizing disorders.

However, despite this overlap, no quantitative genetic studies have addressed the phenotypic overlap and the etiologic association between internalizing and autistic-like traits within the general population. This study aimed to investigate the phenotypic and etiologic relation between internalizing and autistic-like traits using a community-based twin sample. Method: We investigated the co-occurrence of these traits in a population-based sample of 3,233 twin pairs aged 8 to 9 years, using both parent- and teacher-report questionnaires. Bivariate structural equation modeling techniques were used to determine the extent to which internalizing and autistic-like traits shared common genetic and environmental influences. Results: Our results showed that there was a modest phenotypic correlation (r = 0.26-0.29) between autistic-like and internalizing traits. The traits were both substantially heritable but were largely independent with regard to their genetic influences (r(G) = 0.12-0.19). Shared environmental influences were modest but were largely common to both traits. Similar results were found using both parent- and teacher reported data. Conclusions: Internalizing and autistic-like traits showed moderate phenotypic overlap within the general population. This association was explained in small part by shared genetic factors, but the results suggested that most genetic influences were specific to either internalizing traits or autistic traits.

However, cultural diversity has species-typical constraints(1), presumably of genetic origin. A celebrated, if contentious, example is whether a universal grammar constrains syntactic diversity in human languages(2). Oscine songbirds exhibit song learning and provide biologically tractable models of culture: members of a species show individual variation in song(3) and geographically separated groups have local song dialects(4,5). Different species exhibit distinct song cultures(6,7), suggestive of genetic constraints(8,9). Without such constraints, innovations and copying errors should cause unbounded variation over multiple generations or geographical distance, contrary to observations(9). Here we report an experiment designed to determine whether wild-type song culture might emerge over multiple generations in an isolated colony founded by isolates, and, if so, how this might happen and what type of social environment is required(10). Zebra finch isolates, unexposed to singing males during development, produce song with characteristics that differ from the wild-type song found in laboratory(11) or natural colonies. In tutoring lineages starting from isolate founders, we quantified alterations in song across tutoring generations in two social environments: tutor-pupil pairs in sound-isolated chambers and an isolated semi-natural colony. In both settings, juveniles imitated the isolate tutors but changed certain characteristics of the songs. These alterations accumulated over learning generations. Consequently, songs evolved towards the wild-type in three to four generations. Thus, species-typical song culture can appear de novo. Our study has parallels with language change and evolution(12-14). In analogy to models in quantitative genetics(15,16), we model song culture as a multigenerational phenotype partly encoded genetically in an isolate founding population, influenced by environmental variables and taking multiple generations to emerge.",not quantitative genetics,Taeniopygia guttata,zebra finch,Aves,quantified alterations in song across tutoring generations n two social environments.

Yet species in relatively constant environments often adjust phenotypes successfully in rare or novel environments. Developmental biases may reduce the costs of plasticity in common environments, favoring the maintenance of plasticity. We explored this proposition by studying the flexibility of visually guided host-selection behavior in cabbage white butterflies (Pieris rapae), wherein common and rare environments consisted of green and red host types, respectively. We demonstrated in greenhouse assays that adult females display an innate bias toward green color during host search but alter that bias through learning in red-host assemblages such that, after several hours of experience, red hosts are located as efficiently as green hosts. Full-sib analyses suggested there was genetic variation in host and color choice that was more pronounced in the red-host environment. We found no evidence of genetic correlations in behavior across host environments or of fitness costs of plasticity in color choice.

The offspring-parent regression showed that parents had a significant influence on the flight duration of offspring, and the heritability estimated as 0.302. The upward selection increased mean flight duration from 123.7 to 284.6 min in females and from 113.9 to 254.0 min in males during 8 h of flight test; by contrast, downward selection decreased it from 123.7 to 65.6 min in females and from 113.9 to 29.8 min in males, while it did not change significantly in either females or males of the control line over eight generations. The mean realized heritability was estimated as 0.432 based on upward selection but 0.130 on downward selection, suggesting the asymmetry of response to selection on flight capacity.

However, although maternal effects were defined by quantitative geneticists well over half a century ago, there remains some confusion over exactly what phenomena should be characterized as maternal effects and, more importantly, why it matters and how they are defined. We suggest a definition of maternal effects as the causal influence of the maternal genotype or phenotype on the offspring phenotype. This definition differs from some definitions in that it treats maternal effects as a phenomenon, not as a statistical construct. The causal link to maternal genotype or phenotype is the critical component of this definition providing the link between maternal effects and evolutionary and ecological processes. We show why phenomena such as maternal cytoplasmic inheritance and genomic imprinting are distinct genetically from and have different evolutionary consequences than true maternal effects. We also argue that one should consider cases where the maternal effect is conditional on offspring genotype as a class of maternal effects.",define maternal effects as causal influence of maternal genotype or phenotype on offspring phenotype,,,,position paper,,this is the quantittive genetic definition - not sure how useful this will be,probably not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Eared moths have an optimal frequency range between 20 kHz and 50 kHz, which coincides with the peak frequency used by most insectivorous bats. The primary function of the moth ear is to detect and avoid the hunting of bats. Eared moths show a series of defensive behaviors, when they are exposed to the cries emitted by insectivorous bats. The presence of these tympanal organs also set the stage for the later evolution of ultrasonic courtship signals in the eared moth families, Over the years, entomologists worldwide have performed large numbers of studies on hearing of moths and their interactions with bats.

This study aimed, to examine both the phenotypic and genetic differentiation of ARB subtypes within the general population at age 7 and 9. It constituted a follow-zip to an earlier study of ARBs in preschool children. Methods: We investigated the phenotypic structure of ARBs in a large population-based twin sample, comprising 7,834 twin pairs at age 7 and 3,644 twin pairs at age 9. Quantitative genetic modeling techniques were then used to determine the relative influences of genetic and environmental factors upon different types of ARB and upon the covariation between them. Results: Factor analysis supported the presence of five ARB factors at both ages: negative cognitions, negative affect, few; obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and social anxiety. Multivariate genetic analyses revealed significant genetic effects and a small but significant influence of shared environment for all ARB subtypes. There was a moderate level of genetic specificity for each subtype as well as some shared genetic effects. Shared environmental influences correlated highly across all types of ARB, whereas nonshared environmental effects were largely subtype specific. Conclusions: The current results suggest that ARBs call be differentiated both phenotypically and genetically within middle childhood, with subtypes reflecting symptom. groupings of diagnosable disorders but also aspects of temperament. Although some etiological risk factors lead to a generalized vulnerability to anxiety, others may serve to differentiate between different types of ARBs. Depression and Anxiety 26:316-324, 2009.

This assumption implies that begging intensity should be heritable, at least to some degree. Although some studies have suggested that begging is heritable, the evidence for this is rare and mostly indirect. To assess the heritability of begging we used artificial selection, sibling analysis, and the monitoring of begging intensity in four generations of cross-fostered captive house sparrow nestlings. We also contrasted the heritability of begging with that of morphological traits, known to be heritable in this species. Our results show that adult wing length and body mass were heritable as expected. The heritability estimates of the visual and vocal components of nestling begging (standardized for food deprivation and body mass) were low to moderate, as expected for behavioral traits in general, and lower than previously reported for passerine birds.

Hallgrimsson, Benedikt   Garland, Theodore, Jr.", Epigenetic Effects on Integration of Limb Lengths in a Mouse Model:   Selective Breeding for High Voluntary Locomotor Activity,36,2009," Mammals exhibit a similar pattern of integration among homologous limb elements, the strength of which is believed to vary in response to selection for functional coordination or similarity. Although integration is hypothesized to primarily reflect the effect of genes intrinsic to limbs, extrinsic genetic or epigenetic factors may also affect the strength of integration through their impact on the magnitude and direction of skeletal variance or covariance. Such factors as neuromuscular coordination or bone-muscle interactions may therefore play a role in both canalization and the structure or magnitude of limb integration. If this were the case, then increased levels of locomotor activity would be predicted to increase canalization and the magnitude of covariation between limbs. To investigate whether postnatal activity levels can have a significant effect on variance within or covariance among homologous limb elements, we compared four groups of male mice from a long-term selective breeding experiment: (1) mice from lines bred for increased voluntary activity on running wheels and allowed free access to a wheel for 8 weeks beginning at weaning (""active""), (2) selected mice that did not have wheel access (""sedentary""), (3) active mice from non-selected control lines, and (4) sedentary control mice. Mice from selected lines that had wheel access ran significantly more than control-line mice. However, when controlled for activity, linetype, and body mass, results indicate few significant differences in means, variance, or covariation structure, and no significant differences in integration between limbs, suggesting that postnatal activity levels do not significantly affect canalization or integration of limb lengths. A possible explanation for this result is that whereas baseline levels of postnatal activity may help to maintain patterns of variance and integration, increased levels of activity do not further increase these measures. Investigations into disrupted epigenetic processes (e.g., via models in which neuromuscular coordination is impaired) are required to further test hypotheses about how canalization or integration of limb variation is affected by epigenetic factors.",few differences observed,Mus musculus,mouse,Mammalia,selection lines,selection lines,no real patterns of changes in covariance in active or sedentary lines,no,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,not human

De Conto, Valderes", The Evolution of Modularity in the Mammalian Skull II: Evolutionary   Consequences,36,2009," Changes in patterns and magnitudes of integration may influence the ability of a species to respond to selection. Consequently, modularity has often been linked to the concept of evolvability, but their relationship has rarely been tested empirically. One possible explanation is the lack of analytical tools to compare patterns and magnitudes of integration among diverse groups that explicitly relate these aspects to the quantitative genetics framework. We apply such framework here using the multivariate response to selection equation to simulate the evolutionary behavior of several mammalian orders in terms of their flexibility, evolvability and constraints in the skull. We interpreted these simulation results in light of the integration patterns and magnitudes of the same mammalian groups, described in a companion paper. We found that larger magnitudes of integration were associated with a blur of the modules in the skull and to larger portions of the total variation explained by size variation, which in turn can exert a strong evolutionary constraint, thus decreasing the evolutionary flexibility. Conversely, lower overall magnitudes of integration were associated with distinct modules in the skull, to smaller fraction of the total variation associated with size and, consequently, to weaker constraints and more evolutionary flexibility. Flexibility and constraints are, therefore, two sides of the same coin and we found them to be quite variable among mammals. Neither the overall magnitude of morphological integration, the modularity itself, nor its consequences in terms of constraints and flexibility, were associated with absolute size of the organisms, but were strongly associated with the proportion of the total variation in skull morphology captured by size. Therefore, the history of the mammalian skull is marked by a trade-off between modularity and evolvability. Our data provide evidence that, despite the stasis in integration patterns, the plasticity in the magnitude of integration in the skull had important consequences in terms of evolutionary flexibility of the mammalian lineages.","evolution of skull morphology (""evolutionary behavior"") not behavior",Mammalia,mammals,Mammalia,quantitative genetics of skull morphology,,not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Furthermore, all animal species bear a specific relationship between the size of each organ and overall body size, so different body size traits should be investigated as well as their sexual dimorphism that may have an important impact on the evolution of body size. We have surveyed 191 co-isogenic lines of Drosophila melanogaster, each one of them homozygous for a single P-element insertion, and assessed the effects of mutations on different body size traits compared to the P-element-free co-isogenic control. Nearly 60% of the lines showed significant differences with respect to the control for these traits in one or both sexes and almost 35% showed trait- and sex-specific effects. Candidate gene mutations frequently increased body size in males and decreased it in females. Among the 92 genes identified, most are involved in development and/or metabolic processes and their molecular functions principally include protein-binding and nucleic acid-binding activities. Although several genes showed pleiotropic effects in relation to body size, few of them were involved in the expression of all traits in one or both sexes. These genes seem to be important for different aspects related to the general functioning of the organism.

Two progeny tests of M. urundeuva were evaluated. The tests were established in Selviria, MS in 1992 as a heterogeneous plantation, composed of 25 families from Aramina, SP and 25 from Selviria, MS. The following silvicultural traits were evaluated: DBH (Diameter at breast height), DMC (average diameter of crown), height (ALT), stern form (FOR) and survival (SOB). The results based on the REML/BLUP method, suggest that populations of M. urundeuva from Aramina and Selviria have a good adaptation to environmental conditions of Selviria. This became evident by the high survival rate. Genetic variation was higher in the Selviria population when compared to the Aramina population.

Consequently, it has been hypothesized that indirect genetic effects (IGEs) arising from the social environment will provide a major source of heritable variation on which selection can act. However, there has been little empirical scrutiny of this to date. Here we test this hypothesis in an experimental population of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using quantitative genetic models of five aggression traits, we find repeatable and heritable differences in agonistic behaviours of focal individuals when presented with an opponent mouse. For three of the traits, there is also support for the presence of IGEs, and estimated correlations between direct and indirect genetic (rA(O,F)) effects were high. As a consequence, any selection for aggression in the focal individuals should cause evolution of the social environment as a correlated response. In two traits, strong positive rA(O,F) will cause the rapid evolution of aggression, while in a third case changes in the phenotypic mean will be constrained by negative covariance between direct and IGEs. Our results illustrate how classical analyses may miss important components of heritable variation, and show that a full understanding of evolutionary dynamics requires explicit consideration of the genetic component of the social environment.","repeatable and heritable differences in aggression, nd looked for IGEs",Peromyscus maniculatus,deer mice,Mammalia,quantitative genetic models,inbred lines,correlations between direct and indirect genettic effects were high. ,maybe,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,x,,not human

With the imminent sequencing of its genome, the zebra finch is now poised to become a model system for population genetics. Using a panel of 30 noncoding loci, we characterized patterns of polymorphism and divergence among wild zebra finch populations. Continental Australian populations displayed little population structure, exceptionally high levels of nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.010), a rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium (LD), and a high population recombination rate (rho approximate to 0.05), all of which suggest an open and fluid genomic background that could facilitate adaptive variation. By contrast, Substantial divergence between the Australian and Lesser Sunda Island populations (K-ST = 0.193), reduced genetic diversity (pi = 0.002), and higher levels of LD in the island Population suggest a strong but relatively recent founder event, which may have contributed to speciation between these populations as envisioned under founder-effect speciation models. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that tinder a simple quantitative genetic model both drift and selection could have contributed to the observed divergence in six quantitative traits.

There is limited evidence concerning the heritability of these differences, so we evaluated the heritability of cortisol levels in the afternoon and cortisol reactivity using a twin design. The study involved 80 monozygotic (MZ) and 70 dizygotic (DZ) same-sex twin pairs aged 11.2 years on average. Salivary cortisol was measured in the afternoon at home before and after playing a computer game. Ratings of excitement and upset were also obtained, and objective task performance was assessed. Salivary cortisol levels averaged 4.08 (S.D. 2.3) nmol/l at pretask baseline, and declined on average over the session to 3.45 (1.9) nmol/l immediately after the tasks and 2.87 (1.6) nmol/l 10 min later. There were, however, marked individual differences, with cortisol reactivity (difference between pretask baseline and post-task 1) ranging from +4.53 to -6.23 nmol/l. Intra-class correlations for all the cortisol parameters were substantially greater for MZ (range 0.41-0.57) than for DZ (0.11-0.29) twin pairs. Quantitative genetic modelling confirmed significant heritability for pretask baseline cortisol (58%), the two post-task values (60 and 56%), and cortisol reactivity (44%). The study lacked power for assessing sex differences. Subjective reports of excitement were also somewhat heritable, but there was little covariation of cortisol and subjective responses, so genetic influences on covariation could not be tested. These findings indicate that individual differences in children's cortisol levels recorded before tasks and cortisol reactivity to behavioural challenges are influenced by genetic factors.

Two possible questions arise. Q1: what portion of the phenotype of X is due to its genes and what portion to its environment? Q2: what portion of X's phenotypic deviation from the mean is a result of its genetic deviation and what portion a result of its environmental deviation? An answer to Q1 provides the full information about X's development, while an answer to Q2 leaves out a large portion unexplained-that portion which corresponds to the phenotypic mean. Q1 is unanswerable, but I show it is nevertheless legitimate under certain quantitative genetics models. With regard to Q2, opinions in the philosophical and biological literature differ as to its legitimacy. I argue that not only is it legitimate, but in particular, under a few simplifying assumptions, it allows for a quantitative probabilistic answer: for normally distributed quantitative traits with no G-E correlation or statistical G x E interaction, we can assess the probability that X's genes had a greater effect than its environment on its deviation from the mean population value. This probability is expressed as a function the heritability and the individual's phenotypic value; we can also provide a quantitative probabilistic answer to Q2 for an arbitrary individual where the probability is a function only of heritability.",discusses importance of heritbility in understanding genes vs environment,,,,review,,not sure this is a useful article,probably not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Aggressive behavior is genetically complex, with natural variation attributable to multiple segregating loci with allelic effects that are sensitive to the physical and social environment. However, we know little about the genes and genetic networks affecting natural variation in aggressive behavior. Populations of Drosophila melanogaster harbor quantitative genetic variation in aggressive behavior, providing an excellent model system for dissecting the genetic basis of naturally occurring variation in aggression.   Results: Correlating variation in transcript abundance with variation in complex trait phenotypes is a rapid method for identifying candidate genes. We quantified aggressive behavior in 40 wild-derived inbred lines of D. melanogaster and performed a genome-wide association screen for quantitative trait transcripts and single feature polymorphisms affecting aggression. We identified 266 novel candidate genes associated with aggressive behavior, many of which have pleiotropic effects on metabolism, development, and/or other behavioral traits. We performed behavioral tests of mutations in 12 of these candidate genes, and show that nine indeed affected aggressive behavior. We used the genetic correlations among the quantitative trait transcripts to derive a transcriptional genetic network associated with natural variation in aggressive behavior. The network consists of nine modules of correlated transcripts that are enriched for genes affecting common functions, tissue-specific expression patterns, and/or DNA sequence motifs.

To overcome these difficulties, an interdisciplinary approach has been developed which consists in forwards and backwards between modelling, ecophysiological analysis and quantitative genetics. This approach has been applied to studies of fruit quality in peach. A population of 140 genotypes derived from a clone of wild peach (Prunus davidiana) by three generations of crosses with commercial cultivars of nectarine (Prunus persica) was studied and genotyped with 80 markers. The ecophysiological model predicts fruit and stone dry and fresh masses and total sugar concentration in relation to environmental conditions. Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) were detected for all the model parameters and in many cases they were common to both years of experimentation. Co-locations between QTLs for quality traits and QTLs for parameters were observed. The QTL results were used to predict, for any genotype of the populations studied, the values of each parameter which were integrated into the ecophysiological model. This approach could provide a framework for understanding physiological and biological phenomena via the dissection of the quality traits into basic processes. The integration of genetic information into the ecophysiological model may be used for practical purposes, such as predicting the genotypic variations of a plant response to environmental conditions. It may also help to solve genotype and environment (GxE) interactions and to predict the behaviour of plants from the population with any combination of alleles under any climatic scenario.",plants,,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

A nationwide representative sample of 1095 adolescent psychiatric inpatients (46% females) was followed up 15-33 years after admission to the National Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Oslo, Norway. In adolescence 45% fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for a disruptive behaviour disorder. At follow-up, 63% of the males and 39% of the females had a criminal record. Among females. psychoactive substance use disorder in adolescence seemed to be a sine qua non for later registered criminality, with intravenous drug use a potent risk factor for life-course-persistent criminality. The same strong association between drug use and criminality was not found in males. Factor analysis demonstrated that while the DSM-IV Conduct Disorder criteria structure was similar across genders, the prevalence of the various forms of expression was different in males and females. The differences between individuals with violent and non-violent crimes were more substantial in males than in females. There were marked gender differences in the criminal profiles observed, with the females' criminal career developing in a less serious manner than in males: females had later criminal debut, a lower number of acts; on record. less diverse criminal behaviour, and an escalation in the severity of offences over time was less frequently encountered. However. secular trend analyses indicated that gender differences had diminished over the last several decades, with females ""catching up"" with their male counterparts. Overall, the results demonstrated important qualitative and quantitative gender differences in the criminal behaviour of former adolescent psychiatric in-patients.

However, whether obesity and physical inactivity share the same genetic vs environmental etiology has rarely been studied. We therefore analyzed these complex relationships, and also examined whether physical activity modifies the degree of genetic influence on body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC).   Methods: The FinnTwin16 Study is a population-based, longitudinal study of five consecutive birth cohorts (1975-1979) of Finnish twins. Data on height, weight, WC and physical activity of 4343 subjects at the average age of 25 (range, 22-27 years) years were obtained by a questionnaire and self-measurement of WC. Quantitative genetic analyses based on linear structural equations were carried out by the Mx statistical package. The modifying effect of physical activity on genetic and environmental influences was analyzed using gene-environment interaction models.   Results: The overall heritability estimates were 79% in males and 78% in females for BMI, 56 and 71% for WC and 55 and 54% for physical activity, respectively. There was an inverse relationship between physical activity and WC in males (r = -0.12) and females (r = -0.18), and between physical activity and BMI in females (r = -0.12). Physical activity significantly modified the heritability of BMI and WC, with a high level of physical activity decreasing the additive genetic component in BMI and WC.   Conclusions: Physically active subjects were leaner than sedentary ones, and physical activity reduced the influence of genetic factors to develop high BMI and WC. This suggests that the individuals at greatest genetic risk for obesity would benefit the most from physical activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

P."," The future of genetics in psychology and psychiatry: microarrays,   genome-wide association, and non-coding RNA",50,2009," Much of what we thought we knew about genetics needs to be modified in light of recent discoveries. What are the implications of these advances for identifying genes responsible for the high heritability of many behavioural disorders and dimensions in childhood?   Although quantitative genetics such as twin studies will continue to yield important findings, nothing will advance the field as much as identifying the specific genes responsible for heritability. Advances in molecular genetics have been driven by technology, especially DNA microarrays the size of a postage stamp that can genotype a million DNA markers simultaneously. DNA microarrays have led to a dramatic shift in research towards genome-wide association (GWA) studies. The ultimate goal of GWA is to sequence each individual's entire genome, which has begun to happen.   GWA studies suggest that for most complex traits and common disorders genetic effects are much smaller than previously considered: The largest effects account for only 1% of the variance of quantitative traits. This finding implies that hundreds of genes are responsible for the heritability of behavioural problems in childhood, and that it will be difficult to identify reliably these genes of small effect. Another discovery with far-reaching implications for future genetic research is the importance of non-coding RNA (DNA transcribed into RNA but not translated into amino acid sequences), which redefines what the word gene means. Non-coding RNA underlines the need for a genome-wide approach that is not limited to the 2% of DNA responsible for specifying the amino acid sequences of proteins.   The only safe prediction is that the fast pace of genetic discoveries will continue and will increasingly affect research in child psychology and psychiatry. DNA microarrays will make it possible to use hundreds of genes to predict genetic risk and to use these sets of genes in top-down behavioural genomic research that explores developmental change and continuity, multivariate heterogeneity and co-morbidity, and gene-environment interaction and correlation. A crucial question is whether the prediction of genetic risk will be sufficiently robust to translate into genetically based diagnoses, personalised treatments, and prevention programmes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human
 B, MODELING DEMOGRAPHIC PROCESSES IN MARKED POPULATIONS," Cam, EAF Cam, Emmanuelle", Contribution of Capture-Mark-Recapture Modeling to Studies of Evolution   by Natural Selection,3,2009," Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) modeling is one of the most commonly used estimation methods in population ecology of wild animals. Until recently, much of the emphasis of this method was on the estimation of abundance and survival probability. Despite common interest in estimation of such demographic parameters, evolutionary ecologists have often been more critical of CMR estimation methods than wildlife biologists, mostly because the available models did not allow investigators to address what is at the heart of evolutionary ecology. Evolutionary ecology aims at explaining biological diversity: studies in this area of research necessarily involve assessment of variation in traits among individuals, including fitness components. The main limitation of early CMR models was the inability to handle states among which individuals move in a stochastic manner throughout life (e. g., breeding activity and number of offspring raised, locations, physiological states, etc.). Several important advances have enhanced ecologists' ability to address evolutionary hypotheses using CMR data; namely multistate models and models with individual covariates.   Recently, methodological advances have allowed investigators to handle random effects models. This is bringing CMR models close to modern statistical models (Generalized linear mixed models) whose use is rapidly increasing in quantitative genetics. In quantitative genetics, the animal model aims at disentangling sources of phenotypic variation to draw inferences about heritability of any type of trait (morphological, demographic, behavioral, physiological traits). The animal model partitions variation in the trait of interest using variance components. Understanding evolution by natural selection and predicting its pace and direction requires understanding of the genetic and environmental influences on a trait. Phenotypic characteristics such as morphological or life-history traits (i.e. demographic parameters such as number of offspring raised and survival probability) are likely to be influenced by a large number of genes, the genetic basis of which can be quantified via statistical inferences based on similarities among relatives in a population. The extent of evolutionary responses in a quantitative trait is assumed to be proportional to the force of natural selection and heritability of a trait. Estimating the genetic basis of quantitative traits can be tricky for wild animal populations in natural environments: environmental variation often obscures the underlying evolutionary patterns. However, this genetic basis of traits is at the heart of natural selection, and recently there has been increased interest in applying the animal model to natural populations to understand their evolutionary dynamics. Such models have been applied to estimation of heritability in life history traits, either in the rare study populations where detection probability is close to 1, or without considering the probability of detecting animals that are alive and present in the study area (recapture or resighting probability). Applications of the animal model to demographic parameters (fitness components) such as survival, breeding probability or to lifetime reproductive success in wild animal populations where detection probability is < 1 require trans-disciplinary efforts; this is necessary to address evolutionary processes in such populations.",integrating quantitative genetics and capture mark recapture models,,,,review,,this could be interesting for methods section,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

This approach has led to the development of many specific model variants exploring the evolutionary causes of reproductive partitioning in animal groups as well as motivating the empirical investigation of specific model predictions. Here, we discuss a novel quantitative-genetics view of the evolution of reproductive skew, where individual reproductive success and associated phenotypic traits are influenced by genetic interactions amongst social consorts. We first briefly review empirical evidence of genetic variation and constraints on social phenotypes relating to reproductive skew. Second, we develop a biological argument for viewing reproductive skew as the result of social competition and discuss potential gains of using a genetic framework to investigate social evolution. Finally, we describe general predictions and outline a program of study for investigating reproductive skew in this context. We hope that this fresh perspective on the evolution of reproductive skew offers ample scope for exciting future research complementing existing theory. In particular a genetical approach allows posing and investigating questions that could not be answered using traditional game-theory models, for example about past selection patterns, the evolutionary scope for traits that affect skew, and thus the range of behavioral strategies available to group members. Applying a quantitative-genetics approach to understanding patterns of reproductive skew may ultimately yield additional insights into the evolution of sociality.",quantiative genetic view of evolution of reproductive skew,,,,review,,reproductive skew should be viewed as result of social competition. this approach may yield additional insights into the evolution of sociality,maybe,,,x,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,not human

Selection from predation risk on dependent offspring can influence life history strategies of both offspring and parents. Such selection may act on both the form of plastic responses (e.g., the shape of norms of reaction) and mean expression of traits. Consideration of both levels of responses is key to understanding the ecological and evolutionary role of predation on dependent offspring. Here, we discuss how plastic responses and mean expression of life history traits may respond to selection from predation on dependent offspring in nests of birds (i.e., nest predation).

Molecular genetic studies have been successful in identifying genetic variants associated with ADHD, particularly with DSM-IV inattentive and combined subtypes. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) approaches to linkage and association mapping have yet to be widely used in ADHD research, although twin studies investigating individual differences suggest that genetic liability for ADHD is continuously distributed throughout the population, underscoring the applicability of quantitative dimensional approaches. To investigate the appropriateness: of QTL approaches, we tested the familial association between 894 probands with a research diagnosis of DSM-IV ADHD combined type and continuous trait measures among 1,135 of their siblings unselected for phenotype. The sibling recurrence rate for ADHD combined subtype was 12.7%, yielding a sibling recurrence risk ratio (lambda(sib)) of 9.0. Estimated sibling correlations around 0.2-0.3 are similar to those estimated from the analysis of fraternal twins in population twin samples. We further show that there are no threshold effects on the sibling risk for ADHD among the ADHD probands; and that both affected and unaffected siblings contributed to the association with ADRD trait scores. In conclusion, these data confirm the main requirement for QTL mapping of ADHD by demonstrating that narrowly defined DSM-IV combined type probands show familial association with dimensional ADHD symptom scores amongst their siblings.

Grether, Gregory F.", Ornamental evolution in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata):   insights from sensory processing-based analyses of entire colour   patterns,95,2008," The evolution of exaggerated sexual ornamentation is classically thought to proceed as a compromise between opposing vectors of sexual and natural selection. In colour-based ornamentation, as exhibited by guppies (Poecilia reticulata), heightened trait expression may be beneficial in promoting attractiveness, but costly in terms of predation. Opportunities to reconcile this compromise will exist if there are differences between conspecifics and predators in their sensory systems; in such situations guppies should evolve to exploit the ways in which their ornamentation would appear maximally conspicuous to conspecifics. In the present study, we addressed this hypothesis via a study of geographic variation employing the most sophisticated colour analysis yet attempted for Trinidadian guppies. We made two paired contrasts, one between two Aripo populations that vary in the presence of the potential predator Aequidens pulcher, and another between Quare and Marianne populations that vary in exposure to a predatory prawn, Macrobrachium crenulatum. We predicted that, if ornamentation is constrained by the presence of either predator, then guppy conspicuousness should change most markedly across each of the two paired populations as viewed by that predator. Although disparity analysis of entire colour patterns indicated significant differences in both contrasts, this prediction was most clearly supported for the Marianne/Quare contrast. Marianne fish, which co-exist with prawns, exhibited larger black spots coupled with less extensive, less bright flank iridescence. The brightness reductions are notable because, as the only potential guppy predator with a dedicated ultraviolet (UV) photoreceptor, prawns may detect passing male guppies via their UV-bright blues, violets and 'UV/oranges'. We discuss our findings in light of the additional insights that might be obtained by combining spectral assessments and visual modeling with more traditional methods of colour pattern appraisal.

We estimated the contribution of genetic and environmental influences on dietary intake in a large population-based sample of healthy twins. Data originated from a cross-sectional study of 600 male and female healthy twin pairs with self-reported food consumption frequency using a validated questionnaire with 247 foods and recipes. Estimates of relative proportion of additive genetic, nonadditive genetic, shared environmental, and unshared environmental effects on various aspects of dietary intake were obtained by quantitative genetic modeling of twin data based on linear structural equations. The analyses demonstrated genetic influence on total energy, macronutrient energy, and dietary fiber intakes, the glycemic index and the glycemic load of the foods consumed, and the dietary energy density, with significant heritability estimates ranging from 0.25 (0.11-0.38) to 0.47 (0.31-0.60) in men and 0.32 (0.12-0.48) to 0.49 (0.35-0.61) in women. When analyzing dietary intake as the intake of energy from 20 food groups, the genetic and environmental influences differed among food groups and between gender. For some food groups (fruit for both genders, poultry and eggs for men), no genetic influence was found, whereas nonadditive genetic effects were demonstrated for other food groups (juices and eggs for women). A number of food groups had shared environmental influences (potatoes, vegetables, fruits, poultry, fish, margarine, and candy). These results provide evidence for both genetic and shared environmental effects on dietary intake. Although the remaining nonshared environmental effects include measurement errors, there appears to be considerable potential for individually modifiable effects. J.

Although there is a considerable body of game and optimality theory for why the sexes should differ in parental care, genetics can also play a role, and no study has examined how genetic influences might influence differences in parenting. We investigated the extent that genetic variation influenced differences in parenting, whether the evolution of differences could be constrained by shared genetic influences, and how sex-specific patterns of genetic variation underlying parental care might dictate which behaviors are free to evolve in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. Females provided more direct care than males but did not differ in levels of indirect care or the number of offspring they were willing to rear. We found low to moderate levels of heritability and evolvability for all 3 parenting traits in both sexes. Intralocus sexual conflict was indicated by moderately strong intersex genetic correlations., but these were not so strong as to represent an absolute constraint to the evolution of sexual dimorphism in care behavior. Instead, the pattern of genetic correlations between parental behaviors showed sex-specific tradeoffs. Thus, differences in the genetic correlations between parental traits within a sex create sex-specific lines of least evolutionary resistance, which in turn produce the specific patterns of sex differences in parental care. Our results therefore suggest a mechanism for the evolution of behavioral specialization during biparental care if uniparental and biparental care behaviors share the same genetic influences.","moderate to low heritabilities of parental care, with moderately strong intersex genetic correlations.

Vasseur, David A.", Character Convergence under Competition for Nutritionally Essential   Resources,172,2008," Resource competition is thought to drive divergence in resource use traits (character displacement) by generating selection favoring individuals able to use resources unavailable to others. However, this picture assumes nutritionally substitutable resources (e.g., different prey species). When species compete for nutritionally essential resources (e.g., different nutrients), theory predicts that selection drives character convergence. We used models of two species competing for two essential resources to address several issues not considered by existing theory. The models incorporated either slow evolutionary change in resource use traits or fast physiological or behavioral change. We report four major results. First, competition always generates character convergence, but differences in resource requirements prevent competitors from evolving identical resource use traits. Second, character convergence promotes coexistence. Competing species always attain resource use traits that allow coexistence, and adaptive trait change stabilizes the ecological equilibrium. In contrast, adaptation in allopatry never preadapts species to coexist in sympatry. Third, feedbacks between ecological dynamics and trait dynamics lead to surprising dynamical trajectories such as transient divergence in resource use traits followed by subsequent convergence. Fourth, under sufficiently slow trait change, ecological dynamics often drive one of the competitors to near extinction, which would prevent realization of long-term character convergence in practice.",not quantitative genetics,,,,mathematical models,,"model two species competing for two essential resources, possibly a quantitative genetic model , but not really relevant to the chapter",no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

First, we develop a kinship linking algorithm, using the NLSY79 and the NLSY-Children data to link mothers to daughters and aunts to nieces. Then we construct mother-daughter correlations to compare to aunt-niece correlations, an MDAN design, within the context of the quantitative genetic model. The results of our empirical illustration, which uses DF Analysis and generalized estimation equations (GEE) to estimate biometrical parameters from NLSY79 sister-sister pairs and their children in the NLSY-Children dataset, provide both face validity and concurrent validity in support of the efficacy of the design. We describe extensions of the MDAN design. Compared to the typical within-generational design used in most behavior genetic research, the cross-generational feature of this design has certain advantages and interesting features. In particular, we note that the equal environment assumption of the traditional biometrical model shifts in the context of a cross-generational design.

In males of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, sperm length is highly variable but the significance of this variation is unknown. Understanding what determines the reproductive success of male mosquitoes is critical for controlling malaria, and in particular for replacing natural populations with transgenic, malaria-resistant mosquitoes.   Methods: A laboratory population of A. gambiae males was tested for intra-specific variation in sperm length. A full-sib quantitative genetic design was used to test for a genetic component of sperm length in A. gambiae males and estimate its heritability. This study also tested for a relationship between sperm length and male reproductive success in A. gambiae. Male reproductive success was measured as the proportions of inseminated and ovipositing females.   Results: There was intra-specific variation of sperm length in A. gambiae. There was no significant genetic variation in sperm length and its heritability was low (h(2) = 0.18) compared to other insects. Sperm length was correlated with male body size (measured as wing length). Males with short sperm had significantly higher reproductive success than males with long sperm and this was independent of body size.   Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate intra-specific variation in sperm length in A. gambiae and that males with short sperm have higher reproductive success. That sperm length influences female oviposition is important for any strategy considering the release of transgenic males.","No genetyic variation and low heritability of sperm length, and shorter sperm had higher reproductive success -- not behaviors",Anopheles gambiae,mosquito,Insecta,full-sib design,full-sib,not a behavior,no,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Most studies of sperm morphometric variation are done in species with internal fertilization, where sexual selection can be mediated by complex mating behavior and the environment of the female reproductive tract. Far less is known about patterns of sperm evolution in broadcast spawners, where reproductive dynamics are largely carried out at the gametic level. We investigated variation in sperm morphology of a broadcast spawner, the green sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis), within and among spawnings of an individual, among individuals within a population, and among populations. We also examined population-level variation between two reproductive seasons for one population. We then compared among-population quantitative genetic divergence (Q(ST)) for sperm characters to divergence at neutral microsatellite markers (F(ST)).   Results: All sperm traits except total length showed strong patterns of high diversity among populations, as did overall sperm morphology quantified using multivariate analysis. We also found significant differences in almost all traits among individuals in all populations. Head length, axoneme length, and total length had high within-male repeatability across multiple spawnings. Only sperm head width had significant within-population variation across two reproductive seasons. We found signatures of directional selection on head length and head width, with strong selection possibly acting on head length between the Pacific and West Atlantic populations. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of the Q(ST)-F(ST) comparison.   Conclusion: Sperm morphology in S. droebachiensis is highly variable, both among populations and among individuals within populations, and has low variation within an individual across multiple spawnings. Selective pressures acting among populations may differ from those acting within, with directional selection implicated in driving divergence among populations and balancing selection as a possible mechanism for producing variability among males. Sexual selection in broadcast spawners may be mediated by different processes from those acting on internal fertilizers. Selective divergence in sperm head length among populations is associated with ecological differences among populations that may play a large role in mediating sexual selection in this broadcast spawner.",not behavior,Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis,green sea urchin,Echinoidea,quantitative genetic divergence compareted to Fst (Qst/Fst),,focus on sperm morphology not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Fast take-off to intercept females and competing males is an essential behavioral component of the territorial perching behavior in male speckled wood butterflies (Pararge aegeria L.). Females on the other hand avoid frequent take-offs particularly under suboptimal temperatures, typically showing fewer but longer flights than males. We estimated the heritability of takeoff acceleration performance under suboptimal body temperatures by a restricted maximum-likelihood model. We calculated genetic correlations between this performance and a selection of morphological traits: size (body mass), flight muscle investment (relative thorax mass), and wing shape (forewing aspect ratio). Our results show significant additive genetic variation for mean acceleration performance and a similar but nonsignificant trend (P = 0.08) for maximal acceleration performance during take-off in males (h(2) = 0.15). In females, heritability was not significantly different from zero for either of the acceleration performance measures. Morphological traits and take-off performance were genetically linked in a sex-specific way. In males, relative thorax mass and forewing aspect ratio were positively genetically correlated with acceleration performance. In females, there was a negative genetic correlation between acceleration performance and abdomen mass, but not with residual abdomen mass (i.e., regressed on total body mass).

It occupies a unique status among Drosophila species due to certain peculiarities in its genetic behaviour and is of common occurrence in India. Quantitative genetics of sexual and non-sexual traits provided evidence for genetic control of these traits. D. ananassae exhibits high level of chromosomal polymorphism in its natural populations. Indian natural populations of D. ananassae show geographic differentiation of inversion polymorphism due to their adaptation to varying environments and natural selection operates to maintain three cosmopolitan inversions. Populations do not show divergence on temporal scale, an evidence for rigid polymorphism. D. ananassae populations show substantial degree of sub-structuring and exist as semi-isolated populations. Gene flow is low despite co-transportation with human goods. There is persistence of cosmopolitan inversions when populations are transferred to laboratory conditions, which suggests that heterotic buffering is associated with these inversions in D. ananassae. Populations collected from similar environmental conditions that initially show high degree of genetic similarity have diverged to different degrees in laboratory environment. This randomness could be due to genetic drift. Interracial hybridization does not lead to breakdown of heterosis associated with cosmopolitan inversions, which shows that there is lack of genetic co-adaptation in D. ananassae. Linkage disequilibrium between independent inversions in laboratory populations has often been observed, which is likely to be due to suppression of crossing-over and random genetic drift. No evidence for chromosomal interactions has been found in natural and laboratory populations of D. ananassae. This strengthens the previous suggestion that there is lack of genetic co-adaptation in D. ananassae.","""quantitative genetics of sexual and non-sexual traits provided evidence for genetic control of these traits""",Drosophila ananassae,fruit fly,Insecta,review,,maybe read just to learn about sexual traits and heritabilities,probably not,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

One factor contributing to weight variation could be genetically determined differences in appetite that modulate susceptibility to the environment. We assessed the relative contribution of genes and environment for two aspects of appetite that have been implicated in obesity.   Methods: Parents of a population-based sample of 8- to 11-year-old twins (n = 5435 pairs) completed validated, questionnaire measures of responsiveness to satiety and responsiveness to food cues for both children.   Results: Quantitative genetic model fitting gave estimates of 63% (95% confidence interval: 39-81%) for the heritability of satiety responsiveness and 75% (52-85%) for food cue responsiveness. Shared and non-shared environmental influences were 21% (0-51%) and 16% (10-21%) for satiety responsiveness, and 10% (0-38%) and 15% (10-18%) for food cue responsiveness, respectively.   Conclusions: The high heritability of appetitive traits that are known to be related to weight suggests that genetic vulnerability to weight gain could operate through behavioural as well as metabolic pathways. Intervention strategies aimed at improving satiety responsiveness and reducing food cue responsiveness in high-risk individuals could help in preventing the development of obesity.

Indirect genetic effect (IGE) models represent a different approach, specifying social effects on trait values rather than fitness. We investigate the joint effect of relatedness, multilevel selection and IGEs on response to selection. We present a measure for the degree of multilevel selection, which is the natural partner of relatedness in expressions for response. Response depends on both relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection, rather than only one or the other factor. Moreover, response is symmetric in relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection, indicating that both factors have exactly the same effect. Without IGEs, the key parameter is the product of relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection. With IGEs, however, multilevel selection without relatedness can explain evolution of social traits. Thus, next to relatedness and multilevel selection, IGEs are a key element in the genetical theory of social evolution.",not really relevant,,,,model,,"IGEs, relatedness, and multilevel selection are all important in genetical theory of social evolution . multilevel selection without IGEs needs relatedness but with IGEs relatedness is not needed",no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,not human

An evolutionary explanation for this excess requires that the advantages of repeated mating outweigh the costs, and that behavioral components of repeated mating are genetically influenced. There can be benefits of repeated mating for males when there is competition for fertilizations or where the opportunities for inseminating additional mates are rare or unpredictable. The benefits to females are less obvious and, depending on underlying genetic architecture, repeated mating may have evolved as a correlated response to selection on males. We investigated the evolution of repeated mating with the same partner in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides by estimating the direct and indirect fitness benefits for females and the genetics of behavior underlying repeated mating. The number of times a female mated had minimal direct and no indirect fitness benefits for females. The behavioral components of repeated mating (mating frequency and mating speed) were moderately negatively genetically correlated in males and uncorrelated in females. However, mating frequency and mating speed were strongly positively genetically correlated between males and females.

Here we investigated how variation in relative fitness, or the opportunity for sexual selection, affected the evolutionary trajectories of interacting phenotypes. We used experimentally evolved populations of the naturally promiscuous Drosophila pseudoobscura, in which the numbers of potential interactions between the sexes, and therefore relative fitness, were manipulated by altering natural levels of female promiscuity. We considered two different mating interactions between the sexes: mating speed and copulation duration. We investigated the evolutionary trajectories of means and (co)variances (P) and also the influence of genetic drift on the evolutionary response of these interactions.

Different natural populations are likely to experience different selection pressures on the genetic underpinnings of chemosensory behaviour. However, few studies have reported comparisons of the quantitative genetic basis of olfactory behaviour in geographically distinct populations. We generated isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster from six populations in Argentina and measured larval and adult responses to benzaldehyde. There was significant variation within populations for both larval and adult olfactory behaviour and a significant genotype x sex interaction (GSI) for adult olfactory behaviour. However, there is substantial variation in the contribution of GSI to the total phenotypic variance among populations. Estimates of evolvability are orders of magnitude higher for larvae than for adults. Our results suggest that the potential for evolutionary adaptation to the chemosensory environment is greater at the larval feeding stage than at the adult reproductive stage.",quantiative genetic basis of olfactory behavior in geographically distinct lines,Drosophila melanogaster,fruit fly,Insecta,isofemale lines,inbred lines,variation within populations for olfactory behavior and a signficiant gentoype by sex interaction.

In this first autosomal genome-wide association scan of g, we used a two-stage quantitative trait locus (QTL) design with pooled DNA to screen more than 500 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on microarrays, selecting from a sample of 7000 7-year-old children. In stage 1, we screened for allele frequency differences between groups pooled for low and high g. In stage 2, 47 SNPs nominated in stage 1 were tested by individually genotyping an independent sample of 3195 individuals, representative of the entire distribution of g scores in the full 7000 7-year-old children. Six SNPs yielded significant associations across the normal distribution of g, although only one SNP remained significant after a false discovery rate of 0.05 was imposed. However, none of these SNPs accounted for more than 0.4% of the variance of g, despite 95% power to detect associations of that size. It is likely that QTL effect sizes, even for highly heritable traits such as cognitive abilities and disabilities, are much smaller than previously assumed. Nonetheless, an aggregated 'SNP set' of the six SNPs correlated 0.11 (P < 0.00000003) with g. This shows that future SNP sets that will incorporate many more SNPs could be useful for predicting genetic risk and for investigating functional systems of effects from genes to brain to behavior.",cognitive abilities,humans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

H.", Genetic influences on behavioral inhibition and anxiety in juvenile   rhesus macaques,7,2008," In humans and other animals, behavioral responses to threatening stimuli are an important component of temperament. Among children, extreme behavioral inhibition elicited by novel situations or strangers predicts the subsequent development of anxiety disorders and depression. Genetic differences among children are known to affect risk of developing behavioral inhibition and anxiety, but a more detailed understanding of genetic influences on susceptibility is needed. Nonhuman primates provide valuable models for studying the mechanisms underlying human behavior. Individual differences in threat-induced behavioral inhibition (freezing behavior) in young rhesus monkeys are stable over time and reflect individual levels of anxiety. This study used the well-established human intruder paradigm to elicit threat-induced freezing behavior and other behavioral responses in 285 young pedigreed rhesus monkeys. We examined the overall influence of quantitative genetic variation and tested the specific effect of the serotonin transporter promoter repeat polymorphism. Quantitative genetic analyses indicated that the residual heritability of freezing duration (behavioral inhibition) is h(2) = 0.384 (P = 0.012) and of 'orienting to the intruder' (vigilance) is h(2) = 0.908 (P = 0.00001). Duration of locomotion and hostility and frequency of cooing were not significantly heritable. The serotonin transporter polymorphism showed no significant effect on either freezing or orienting to the intruder. Our results suggest that this species could be used for detailed studies of genetic mechanisms influencing extreme behavioral inhibition, including the identification of specific genes that are involved in predisposing individuals to such behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Selection on one trait within a hormone-mediated suite may, for example, lead to a change in the strength of the hormone signal, causing either beneficial or detrimental changes in correlated traits. Theory and empirical methods for studying correlated trait evolution have been developed by the field of evolutionary quantitative genetics, and here we suggest that their application to the study of hormone-mediated suites may prove fruitful. We present hypotheses for how selection shapes the evolution of hormone-mediated suites and argue that correlational selection, which arises when traits interact in their effects on fitness, may act to alter or conserve the composition of hormone-mediated suites. Next, we advocate using quantitative genetic methods to assess natural covariation among hormone-mediated traits and to measure the strength of natural selection acting on them. Finally, we present illustrative examples from our own work on the evolution of testosterone-mediated suites in male and female dark-eyed juncos.

Consequently, there is considerable interest in predicting the long-term evolutionary trajectories of extant populations. Knowledge of the genetic architecture of fitness traits is integral to making these predictions. We reviewed the published, peer-reviewed literature for estimates of heritability and genetic correlation for fitness traits in salmonine fishes with two broad goals in mind: summarization of published data and testing for differences among categorical variables (e. g., species, life history type, experimental conditions). Balanced coverage of variables was lacking and estimates for wild populations and behavioral traits were nearly absent. Distributions of heritability estimates were skewed toward low values and distributions of genetic correlations toward large, positive values, suggesting that significant potential for evolution of traits exists. Furthermore, experimental conditions had a direct effect on h(2) estimates, and other variables had more complex effects on h(2) and r(G) estimates, suggesting that available estimates may be insufficient for use in models to predict evolutionary change in wild populations. Given this and other inherent complicating factors, making accurate predictions of the evolutionary trajectories of salmonine fishes will be a difficult task.",not incredibly relevant,Salmonidae,salmonid fishes,Actinopterygii,review,,estimates for wild populations and behavioral traits were nearly absent. reviewed literature for estimates of heritability and genetic correlation for fitness traits,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

We describe regions of plant genomes that affect pollinator preferences for two species of Louisiana Irises, Iris brevicaulis and Iris fulva, and their artificial hybrids. Iris brevicaulis and I. fulva possess bee and bird-pollination syndromes, respectively. Hummingbirds preferred I. fulva and under-visited both I. brevicaulis and backcrosses toward this species. Lepidopterans preferred I. fulva and backcrosses toward I. fulva, but also under-visited I. brevicaulis and I. brevicaulis backcrosses. Bumblebees preferred I. brevicaulis and F-1 hybrids and rarely visited I. fulva. Although all three pollen vectors preferred one or the other species, these preferences did not prevent visitation to other hybrid/parental classes. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, in reciprocal BC1 mapping populations, defined the genetic architecture of loci that affected pollinator behavior. We detected six and nine QTLs that affected pollinator visitation rates in the BCIb and BCIf mapping populations, respectively, with as many as three QTLs detected for each trait. Overall, this study reflects the possible role of quantitative genetic factors in determining (1) reproductive isolation, (2) the pattern of pollinator-mediated genetic exchange, and thus (3) hybrid zone evolution.",describe regions of plant genomes that affect pollinator preferences,Louisiana irises,,,backcrosses between species,"F1 backcross, QTL mapping",not really about the behavior?,no,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

To identify candidate genes affecting sleep, we assayed 136 isogenic P-element insertion lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Since sleep has been negatively correlated with energy reserves across taxa, we measured energy stores (whole-body protein, glycogen, and triglycerides) in these lines as well. Twenty-one insertions with known effects on physiology, development, and behavior affect 24-hr sleep time. Thirty-two candidate insertions significantly impact energy stores. Mutational genetic correlations among sleep parameters revealed that the genetic basis of the transition between sleep and waking states in males and females may be different. Furthermore, sleep bout number can be decoupled from waking activity in males, but not in females. Significant genetic correlations are present between sleep phenotypes and glycogen stores in males, while sleep phenotypes are correlated with triglycerides in females. Differences observed in male and female sleep behavior in flies may therefore be related to sex-specific differences in metabolic needs. Sleep thus emerges as a complex trait that exhibits extensive pleiotropy and sex specificity. The large mutational target that we observed implicates genes functioning in a variety of biological processes, suggesting that sleep may serve a number of different functions rather than a single purpose.",focus on mutations impacting sleep,Drosophila melanogaster,fruit fly,Insecta,isogenic lines,inbred lines,"genetic correlations present between sleep and glycogen stores in males and triglycerides in females, possibly reflecting sex-specific differences in metabolic needs.

Trees were assessed in the summer of 2005 for traits relating to attack, survival, gallery formation, and infection from the fungi associated with MPB, Ophiostoma sp. Successful initial attack was determined by the presence of dead (i.e., red or gray foliage) crowns and the presence of entrance holes from MPB. Eighty-seven percent of the trees still had green crowns in the fall of 2005 (GC05), with family mean differences ranging from 46 to 100%. The mean number of pitch tubes per tree (PT#05) (in a sampling area of 225 cm(2) at breast height) was 1.5 with a range from 0 to 14 per tree. However, for pitch tubes indicating presence or absence (PTP05) of MPB on each tree, 63% of the trees had pitch tubes and family means ranged from 7 to 100%. Significant levels of genetic variation were found for GC05 and PTP05 with narrow-sense heritabilities of 0.20 (SE = 0.11) and 0.26 (SE = 0.07), respectively. Provenance differences were also significant, indicating that some population structure is present for these ""resistance"" attributes. The family breeding value correlations between 10-year height growth and PTP05 was 0.22, indicating that at the population level faster growing families may be slightly more subject to attack. An intensive survey of a subsample of 442 trees in the test (selected from 50 families with a range of attack levels) was conducted, and trees were reassessed for the presence of attack, presence of blue stain in the wood, and presence of galleries and egg chambers/eggs in the gallery. Family means ranged from 0 to 57% for blue stain, 11 to 63% for galleries, and 0 to 57% for egg chambers/eggs; however, due to the relatively small sample sizes and the nature of the binary data, family differences were not highly statistically significant.

Drosophila males use their sex combs to grasp the females' abdomen and genitalia and to spread their wings prior to copulation. To test the role of this structure in male mating success in Drosophila melanogaster, we genetically ablated the sex comb by expressing the female-specific isoform of the sex determination gene transformer in the tarsal segments of male legs. This technique does not remove the sex comb entirely, but simply restores the morphology of its constituent bristles to the ancestral condition found in Drosophila species that lack sex combs. Direct observations and differences in long-term insemination rates show that the loss of the sex comb strongly reduces the ability of males to copulate with females. Detailed analysis of video recordings indicates that this effect is not due to changes in the males' courtship behavior. Rapid evolution of sex comb morphology may be driven either by changes in female preferences, or by co-evolution between sex combs and female external genitalia.",not behavior,Drosophila melanogaster,fruit fly,Insecta,genetically ablated the sex comb,,loss of the sex comb reduces male aability to copulate - not really relevant,no,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Male and female twins (n=2009 complete twin pairs) evaluated use-frequencies of 24 food items using 5 categories (1=never-5=several times a day) in a postal questionnaire. Foods were categorized by factor analysis. Estimates of the relative proportions of additive genetic, shared environmental, and unshared environmental effects on the use-frequency of food items and factor scores were obtained by quantitative genetic modeling of twin data based on linear structural equations. Four factors of food use were identified: ""healthy"" foods, high-fat foods, sweet foods, and meats. The variance of the use-frequency of food items and food categories was explained by additive genetic and unshared environmental influences, whereas shared environmental factors did not contribute to food use. The average proportions of genetic effects on the total variance of the use-frequency of food items and food categories were 40% and 45%, respectively. Sex differences were observed in the magnitude of genetic influences for use-frequency of four food items (chocolate, other sweets, fried foods, and meat), and in genetic factors underlying the use of three (fresh vegetables, fruits, and cheeses) items. In conclusion, family environment does not appear to influence the food use of young adults and thus nutritional education should be targeted at this age group to support development of healthy eating patterns. In addition, the results illuminate the importance of the sex-specific genetic effects on food use. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Here, we evaluate whether four genes of the canine serotonergic system, coding for the serotonin receptors 1A, 1B, and 2A, and the serotonin transporter, could play a major role in aggression in Golden Retrievers. We performed mutation screens, linkage analysis, an association study, and a quantitative genetic analysis. There was no systematic difference between the coding DNA sequence of the candidate genes in aggressive and non-aggressive Golden Retrievers. An affecteds-only parametric linkage analysis revealed no strong major locus effect on human-directed aggression related to the candidate genes. An analysis of 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 1 Mb regions flanking the genes in 49 unrelated human-directed aggressive and 49 unrelated non-aggressive dogs did not show association of SNP alleles, genotypes, or haplotypes with aggression at the candidate loci. We completed our analyses with a study of the effect of variation in the candidate genes on a collection of aggression-related phenotypic measures. The effects of the candidate gene haplotypes were estimated using the Restricted Maximum Likelihood method, with the haplotypes included as fixed effects in a linear animal model. We observed no effect of the candidate gene haplotypes on a range of aggression-related phenotypes, thus extending our conclusions to several types of aggressive behavior.

Here, I couple behavioral experiments involving manipulations of ambient light environments and male reflectance patterns with observation of wild mating patterns to investigate visual mating biases in the large grass yellow (Eurema hecabe). Males in this species possess exaggerated, limited-view ultraviolet (UV) iridescence across most of their dorsal wing surface that has putative sexual signaling function. In the first experiment, conducted in small (0.7-m(3)) cages, individuals were significantly less likely to copulate when the UV portion of natural ambient illumination (i.e., 300-400 nm) was strongly reduced. In 2 subsequent experiments, conducted under full-spectrum sunlight in small and large (5 x 6 x 4 m) cages, males with their UV signal artificially dulled by 25% consistently copulated with fewer, and smaller, females than sham-control individuals. Importantly, the manipulated levels of UV brightness in these experiments fall well within the naturally occurring bounds of variation in male UV reflectance. These findings therefore unanimously support the presence of a UV signal-based female bias. In apparent contrast, comparison of 161 in-copula and 188 free-flying males from a high-density field assemblage revealed that copulating males were significantly older and henceforth actually possessed (subtly) less UV bright wings. Copulating male UV brightness was, however, positively related to the size of their mate, which echoes the experimental findings and may represent a signature of mutual mate choice. I discuss these results in light of the full complexities of the butterfly mating system and the potential signaling value of iridescent coloration in butterflies and animals generally.",not quantitative genetics,Eurema hecabe,large grass yellow butterfly,Insecta,behavioral experiments and observation of wild mating patterns,,females judge males based on UV brightness,read,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

This information can be useful for our fundamental understanding of population differentiation, as well as for identifying management units in conservation biology. Here, we provide comprehensive review and meta-analysis of the empirical studies that have compared quantitative genetic (Q(ST)) and neutral marker (F-ST) differentiation among natural populations. Our analyses confirm the conclusion from previous reviews - based on ca. 100% more data - that the Q(ST) values are on average higher than F-ST values [mean difference 0.12 (SD 0.27)] suggesting a predominant role for natural selection as a cause of differentiation in quantitative traits. However, although the influence of trait (life history, morphological and behavioural) and marker type (e.g. microsatellites and allozymes) on the variance of the difference between Q(ST) and F-ST is small, there is much heterogeneity in the data attributable to variation between specific studies and traits. The latter is understandable as there is no reason to expect that natural selection would be acting in similar fashion on all populations and traits (except for fitness itself). We also found evidence to suggest that Q(ST) and F-ST values across studies are positively correlated, but the significance of this finding remains unclear.

To study genetic determinants, model systems such as the Naples rat lines, i.e. Naples high (NHE) and low excitability (NLE), are useful. They have been selectively bred for divergent behaviour arousal to novelty. Aim of this study was to assess the extent of the genetic control of the selection trait. Thus adult albino rats of NHE and NLE lines have been used throughout. According to a classical Mendelian cross-breeding design, a first experiment was carried out with hybrids obtained from parental lines PI (NHE) and P2 (NLE) as F1, F2 and related backcrosses B1 (F1 x P1) and B2 (F1 x P2). Young adults (60-80 days) offspring of both gender were exposed separately for two 10 min tests to a spatial novelty (Lat-maze). To verify a possible sex link of the trait, a second experiment was carried out adding to the Mendelian cross design parental gender. Behavioural variables were horizontal (corner-crossings: HA), vertical (rearings on hindlimbs: VA) or total activity (HVA: HA + VA) scores.   The heritability of HVA trait was estimated across the 20 generations of selection and Mendelian cross hybrids. Quantitative-genetic analysis on this trait and its HA and VA components, was applied by the Lynch and Walsh joint-scaling test procedure to evaluate underlying genetic mechanism. The correlation between experimental data of hybrids and estimated values from different heritability models were also computed.

Classical models of coevolution between mating system and inbreeding depression predict negative associations between inbreeding depression and selfing rate, but more recent approaches suggest that negative correlations should usually be too weak or transient to be detected within populations. Empirical results remain unclear and restricted to plants. Here, we evaluate, for the first time, the within-population genetic correlation between inbreeding depression and a trait that controls the amount of self-fertilization (the waiting time) in a self-fertile hermaphroditic animal, the freshwater snail Physa acuta. Using a large quantitative-genetic design (36 grand-families and 348 families), we observe abundant within-population family-level genetic variation for both inbreeding depression (estimated for survival, fecundity, and size) and the degree of behavioral selfing avoidance. However, we detected no correlation between waiting time and inbreeding depression across families. In agreement with recent models, this result shows that mutational variance rather than differential purging accounts for most of the genetic variance in inbreeding depression within a population.",within-population genetic correlation between inbreeding depression and self-fertilization behavior,Physa acuta,snail,Gastropoda,quantitative genetic design of grand-families and families,full-sib,"within-population family-level genetic variation for inbreeding depression and behavioral selfing avoidance, but not correlation between selfing and inbreeding depression ",maybe,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

We analysed genetic and environmental influences on self-esteem and its stability in adolescence.   Method. Finnish twins born in 1983-1987 were assessed by questionnaire at ages 14 (n = 4132 twin individuals) and 17 years (n=3841 twin individuals). Self-esteem was measured using the Rosenberg global self-esteem scale and analyzed using quantitative genetic methods for twin data in the Mx statistical package.   Results. The heritability of self-esteem was 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56-0.68] in 14-year-old boys and 0.40 (95% CI 0.26-0.54) in 14-year-old girls, while the corresponding estimates at age 17 were 0.48 (95% CI 0.39-0.56) and 0.29 (95% CI 0.11-0.45). Rosenberg self-esteem scores at ages 14 and 17 were modestly correlated (r = 0.44 in boys, r = 0.46 in girls). In boys, the correlation was mainly (82%) due to genetic factors, with residual co-variation due to unique environment. In girls, genetic (31%) and common environmental (61%) factors largely explained the correlation.   Conclusions. In adolescence, self-esteem seems to be differently regulated in boys versus girls.

U.", Is reduced female survival after mating a by-product of male-male   competition in the dung fly Sepsis cynipsea?,7,2007," Background: In a number of species males damage females during copulation, but the reasons for this remain unclear. It may be that males are trying to manipulate female mating behaviour or their life histories. Alternatively, damage may be a side-effect of male-male competition. In the black scavenger or dung fly Sepsis cynipsea ( Diptera: Sepsidae) mating reduces female survival, apparently because males wound females during copulation. However, this damage does not seem to relate to attempted manipulation of female reproduction by males. Here we tested the hypothesis that harming females during mating is an incidental by-product of characters favoured during precopulatory male-male competition. We assessed whether males and their sons vary genetically in their ability to obtain matings and harm females, and whether more successful males were also more damaging. We did this by ranking males' mating success in paired competitions across several females whose longevity under starvation was subsequently measured.   Results: As previously reported, our results show mating is costly for female S. cynipsea. However, variance in female longevity was not explained by male identity, family, body size, number of previous copulations, or copulation duration. Nevertheless, there was a positive correlation between the harm fathers inflicted on their mates ( affecting female longevity) and the harm sons inflicted on theirs. Additionally, family identity significantly influenced male copulation success.   Conclusion: Our results indicate a heritable component of some yet unspecified male trait(s) that influence harm and mating success. However, there was no relationship between copulation success of fathers or sons and the mean longevity of their mates. We therefore found no support for harm being a side effect of traits favoured in pre-copulatory male-male competition.",correlation between fathers' and sons' mating success and female harm behaviors,Sepsis cynipsea,dung fly,Insecta,measured ability to mate and harm females in paired competitions with fathers and sons. ,other,not precisely quantitative genetics,probably not,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

To study the changes of metabolism among different ages or generations as well as the repeatability during the ontogeny, we carried out the research in Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii), which covered two generations' life.

Resting metabolic rate within the thermoneutral zone, resting metabolic rate at 5 degrees C, non-shivering thermogenesis and maximal metabolic rate during thermogenesis in both juveniles and adults were simultaneously measured. Population-average values of aerobic traits were generally consistent among different ages or generations; however, there was no repeatability at the level of individual variation during the ontogeny, which indicated that the aerobic traits of the young were not good indicators for that of later life. At the same time, the coefficient of intraclass correlation for full sibs failed to reach statistical significance, suggesting that heritability of aerobic traits in Brandt's votes was not high.

Combining optimal foraging theory and quantitative genetics in a spatially explicit, individual-based model, we show that flowers with long corolla tubes can alternatively evolve because they promote resource partitioning among nectar feeders and increase the probability of conspecific pollen transfer. When there is competition for resources, long-tongued flower visitors feed preferentially at deep flowers and short-tongued visitors at shallow flowers. Both plant species thus benefit when the depths of their corollas are so different that each flower visitor specializes on one species. Resource competition can promote the evolution of deep corollas despite the presence of significant amounts of noise, such as deviations from optimal foraging behavior due to perceptual errors or temporal fluctuations in the relative abundance of competing pollinator species. Our results can explain the evolution of long corollas in a number of systems that do not conform to the traditional view.",plants - not behaviors,plants,,,,,not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

It involves a typical and unique pre-dispersal 'tiptoe' behaviour that can easily be observed under laboratory conditions.   Hypotheses: Is the ballooning behaviour of a saltmarsh-inhabiting spider heritable? Do heritability estimates differ under two different environmental conditions (wind velocity)?

We conducted a quantitative (half-sib) genetic analysis of ballooning motivation and applied threshold models to estimate heritabilities under both wind conditions.   Results: Heritability estimates were 0. 17 (standard error = 0.07) at low wind velocities and 0.42 (standard error= 0.21) at high wind velocities.

Garcia-Gonzalez, F.", Female crickets trade offspring viability for fecundity,20,2007," A growing number of studies are suggesting that females can improve the viability of their embryos by mating with multiple males. However, the reason why females should have low rates of embryo viability is puzzling. Here we conduct a quantitative genetic study of maternal effects on embryo viability in the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus. After controlling for female body size, we find significant additive genetic variance for ovary weight, a measure of fecundity, and egg hatching success, a measure of embryo viability. Moreover, we show a genetic trade-off between these traits that is predicted from life-history theory. High rates of embryo mortality in this highly fecund species might therefore be explained by selection favouring an optimum balance between fecundity and embryo viability that maximizes maternal fitness. Paternal effects on female fecundity and embryo viability are often seen as benefits driving the evolution of polyandrous behaviour. However, we raise the alternative possibility that paternal effects might shift females from their naturally selected optimum, and present some support for the notion that sexual conflict over a female's optimal fecundity and embryo viability might generate antagonistic coevolution between the sexes.",quantitative genetic estudy of embryo viability 00 not behavior,Teleogryllus oceanicus,field cricket,Insecta,quantitative genetic study,,not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,s,,not human

Wenzel, Timothy T.", Mechanism of activation of a hafnium pyridyl-amide olefin polymerization   catalyst: Ligand modification by monomer,129,2007," We have investigated the olefin polymerization mechanism of hafnium catalysts supported by a pyridyl-amide ligand with an ortho-metalated naphthyl group. Ethylene-alpha-olefin copolymers from these catalysts have broad molecular weight distributions that can be fit to a bimodal distribution. We propose a unique mechanism to explain this behavior involving monomer modification of the catalyst, which generates multiple catalyst species when multiple monomers are present. More specifically, we present evidence that the hafnium alkyl cation initially undergoes monomer insertion into the Hf-naphthyl bond, which permanently modifies the ligand to generate new highly active olefin polymerization catalysts. Under ethylene/octene copolymerization conditions, a plurality of new catalysts is formed in relative proportion to the respective monomer concentrations. Due to the asymmetry of the metal complex, two ""ethylene-inserted"" and eight ""octene-inserted"" isomers are possible, but it is a useful approximation to consider only one of each in the polymerization behavior. Consequently, gel permeation chromatography data for the polymers can be fit to a bimodal distribution having a continuous shift from a predominantly low molecular weight fraction to predominantly higher molecular weight fraction as [octene]/[ethylene] is increased. Theoretical calculations show that such insertions into the Hf-aryl bond have lower barriers than corresponding insertions into the Hf-alkyl bond. The driving forces for this insertion into the Hf-aryl bond include elimination of an eclipsing H-H interaction and formation of a stabilizing Hf-arene interaction. These new ""monomer-inserted catalysts"" have no beta-agostic interaction, very weak olefin binding, and olefin-insertion transition states which differ on the two sides by more than 4 kcal/mol. Thus, the barrier to site epimerization is very low and high polymerization rates are possible even when the chain wags prior to every insertion. Experimental evidence for aryl-insertion products is obtained from reactions of ethylene ((C2H4)-C-13 NMR studies) or 4-methyl-1-pentene (4M1P) using relatively low monomer/catalyst ratios. Quantitative generation of monomer-inserted products is complicated by slow initiation kinetics followed by fast polymerization kinetics. However, NMR evidence for reaction with (C2H4)-C-13 was observed in situ at low temperature, and the attachment of monomer to ligand was confirmed by GC/MS and C-13 NMR after quenching. Furthermore, a 4M1P-appended ligand was isolated from a polymerization reaction (50:1 monomer:catalyst) by column chromatography followed by multiple recrystallizations. One isomer was characterized by X-ray crystallography, which unequivocally shows a 4-methylpentyl substituent at the 2-position of the naphthyl, consistent with 1,2-insertion into the Hf-aryl bond. NMR suggests a second diastereomer (not isolated) is formed from a 1,2-insertion of opposite stereoselectivity.",not relevant,,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

How to estimate relatedness accurately from genetic marker information has been explored recently by many methodological studies. In this investigation I propose a new likelihood method that uses the genotypes of a triad of individuals in estimating pairwise relatedness (r). The idea is to use a third individual as a control (reference) in estimating the r between two other individuals, thus reducing the chance of genes identical in state being mistakenly inferred as identical by descent. The new method allows for inbreeding and accounts for genotype errors in data. Analyses of both simulated and human microsatellite and SNP datasets show that the quality of r estimates (measured by the root mean squared error, RMSE) is generally improved substantially by the new triadic likelihood method (TL) over the dyadic likelihood method and five moment estimators. Simulations also show that genotyping errors/mutations, when ignored, result in underestimates of r for related dyads, and that incorporating a model of typing errors in the TL method improves r estimates for highly related dyads but impairs those for loosely related or unrelated dyads. The effects of inbreeding were also investigated through simulations. It is concluded that, because most dyads in a natural population are unrelated or only loosely related, the overall performance of the new triadic likelihood method is the best, offering r estimates with a RMSE that is substantially smaller than the five commonly used moment estimators and the dyadic likelihood method.",all about calculating relatedness,,,,review and simulations,,replaced by more recent review,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES," Miller, CW   Moore, AJAF Miller, Christine W.   Moore, Allen J.", A potential resolution to the lek paradox through indirect genetic   effects,274,2007," Females often prefer males with elaborate traits, even when they receive no direct benefits from their choice. In such situations, mate discrimination presumably has genetic advantages; selective females will produce offspring of higher genetic quality. Over time, persistent female preferences for elaborate secondary-sexual traits in males should erode genetic variance in these traits, eventually eliminating any benefit to the preferences. Yet, strong female preferences persist in many taxa. This puzzle is called the lek paradox and raises two primary questions: do females obtain genetic benefits for offspring by selecting males with elaborate secondary-sexual characteristics and, if so, how is the genetic variation in these male traits maintained? We suggest that indirect genetic effects may help to resolve the lek paradox. Maternal phenotypes, such as habitat selection behaviours and offspring provisioning, often influence the condition and the expression of secondary-sexual traits in sons. These maternal influences are commonly genetic based (i.e. they are indirect genetic effects). Females choosing mates with elaborate traits may receive 'good genes' for daughters in the form of effective maternal characteristics. Recognizing the significance of indirect genetic effects may be important to our understanding of the process and consequences of sexual selection.",focus on female preferences and the lek paradox - suggest that IGE may resolve the paradox. ,,,,review/synthesis,,read for IGE,yes,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,not human

Although previous research has consistently indicated that genetic factors contribute to variance in risk for AD, little attention has been paid to nonrandom mating for AD. When assortative mating occurs for a heritable trait, spouses are genetically correlated and offspring are at increased risk of receiving high-risk genes from both parents. The primary goal of the present analyses is to test hypotheses about the source(s) and magnitude of spousal associations for AD using a twin-spouse design.   Methods: DSM-IV AD (without the clustering criterion) was assessed via telephone interview for 5,974 twin members of an older cohort of the Australian Twin Register (born 1902-1964) and 3,814 spouses of the twins. Quantitative genetic modeling was used to determine the extent to which variability in risk for AD was influenced by genetic factors, the extent of spousal association for AD, and whether the association was attributable to assortative mating, reciprocal spousal interaction, or both processes.   Results: Genetic factors explained 49% of the variance in risk for AD. There was no evidence of gender differences in the spousal interaction effect, the degree of rater bias, or the association between the twin's report of spouse AD and the spouse's AD phenotype. Either the assortative mating parameter or the spousal interaction parameter could be removed from the model without a significant decrement in fit, but both could not be dropped simultaneously, suggesting a lack of power to differentiate between these 2 causes of spousal correlation. When both effects were included in the model, the spousal correlation was 0.29, the assortative mating coefficient was 0.45 (i.e., ""like marries like""), and the reciprocal spousal interaction coefficient was -0.10 (i.e., after controlling for assortative mating, the additional impact of spousal interactions is slightly protective).   Conclusions: These analyses provide evidence of significant spousal associations for AD, with assortative mating increasing spouse similarity and spousal interaction effects decreasing it after controlling for assortative mating. Although the genetic impact is modest, assortative mating results in an increased proportion of offspring exposed to 2 alcoholic parents and the associated detrimental environmental sequelae, and increases the likelihood of offspring inheriting high-risk genes from both parents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

For example, some personality syndromes suggest the existence of an underlying hormonal link, whereas other relationships between boldness and aggression appear to be the result of similar selective pressures. Here, we used 1 wild-derived and 2 laboratory strains of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to examine relationships among 5 behavioral measures: shoaling, activity level, predator approaches, latency to feed after a disturbance, and biting to a mirror stimulus. We found evidence of an activity syndrome, as if underlying metabolic costs influence variation in multiple forms of behavior. Evidence for a relationship between boldness and aggression was also apparent but depended both on strain and which specific behavior patterns were identified as measures of ""boldness."" Although some comparisons of laboratory and wild-derived strains were consistent with a domestication syndrome, others were not. Most observed relationships were relatively weak and occasionally inconsistent, arguing against strong underlying genetic linkages or pleiotropic effects relating any of the behavioral measures. Instead, it may be more important to study the details of selective context or the long-term impact of linkages between some, but not all, of a large set of genes influencing complex behavioral traits.

We carried out a quantitative genetic analysis of multiple host use traits, estimated on five species of host plants, in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Mean values of all characters varied among host plants, providing evidence that adaptation to plants may require evolution of both behavioral (preference) and post-ingestive physiological (performance) characteristics. Significant additive genetic variation was detected for several characters on several hosts, but not in the capacity to use the two major hosts, a pattern that might be caused by directional selection. No negative genetic correlations across hosts were detected for any 'performance' traits, i.e. we found no evidence of trade-offs in fitness on different plants. Larval consumption was positively genetically correlated across host plants, suggesting that diet generalization might evolve as a distinct trait, rather than by independent evolution of feeding responses to each plant species, but several other traits did not show this pattern. We explored genetic correlations among traits expressed on a given plant species, in a first effort to shed light on the number of independent traits that may evolve in response to selection for host-plant utilization.

Method: A nonparametric quantitative genome scan was performed using the Social Responsiveness Scale in a cohort of about 100 families with two or more autistic probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange to identify autism loci. To determine which additional loci were detected, linkage analysis with the same autism cohort using the qualitative diagnosis of autism was performed. To assess whether there were likely to be sex-specific genetic risk factors, the cohort was stratified by the sex of affected individuals.

A field-collected population of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), from Celeryville, OH, was selected with permethrin to determine whether low heterogeneous doses could lead to increased susceptibility to permethrin by selecting indirectly on behavior. Two replicates of each of three selection regimes: uniform high concentration hypothesized to result in increased physiological tolerance, heterogeneous low concentration hypothesized to result in increased susceptibility through indirect selection on behavior, and a control with no exposure to permethrin, were maintained in 1-m(3) cages in a greenhouse, for 33 generations. All life stages of the diamondback moth were exposed to the selection regimes, and new generations were started with a random selection of pupae from the previous generation. Lines selected with uniform high concentrations developed 76-fold levels of resistance to permethrin by the 17th generation, with little changes thereafter. For generations 1-20, lines selected with heterogeneous low concentrations remained slightly lower in LC50 but not significantly different from the unselected control lines. Based on confidence intervals from probit analyses, the LC50 of the lines selected with heterogeneous low concentration, however, were significantly lower than those of the control lines in generations 21-33. Our results demonstrate that selection on behavioral responses can result in greater susceptibility than no selection at all, despite exposure to the toxin and ample genetic variation and potential for increased physiological tolerance.

Plants can produce viable and fertile aneuploid individuals, while most animal aneuploids are inviable or developmentally abnormal. The swarms of aneuploid progeny produced by Arabidopsis triploids constitute an excellent model to investigate the mechanisms governing dosage sensitivity and aneuploid syndromes. Indeed, genotype alters the frequency of aneuploid types within these swarms. Recombinant inbred lines that were derived from a triploid hybrid segregated into diploid and tetraploid individuals. In these recombinant inbred lines, a single locus, which we call SENSITIVE TO DOSAGE IMBALANCE ( SDI), exhibited segregation distortion in the tetraploid subpopulation only. Recent progress in quantitative genotyping now allows molecular karyotyping and genetic analysis of aneuploid populations. In this study, we investigated the causes of the ploidy-specific distortion at SDI. Allele frequency was distorted in the aneuploid swarms produced by the triploid hybrid. We developed a simple quantitative measure for aneuploidy lethality and using this measure demonstrated that distortion was greatest in the aneuploids facing the strongest viability selection. When triploids were crossed to euploids, the progeny, which lack severe aneuploids, exhibited no distortion at SDI. Genetic characterization of SDI in the aneuploid swarm identified a mechanism governing aneuploid survival, perhaps by buffering the effects of dosage imbalance. As such, SDI could increase the likelihood of retaining genomic rearrangements such as segmental duplications. Additionally, in species where triploids are fertile, aneuploid survival would facilitate gene flow between diploid and tetraploid populations via a triploid bridge and prevent polyploid speciation.

Using a large-scale cross-fostering experiment, we were able to measure genetic, common environmental and phenotypic correlations between four colour traits and two skeletal traits in a wild population of passerine birds, the blue tit (Parus caeruleus). Colour traits had little heritable variation but common environment effects were found to be important; skeletal traits showed the opposite pattern. Positive correlations because of a shared natal environment were found between all traits, obscuring negative genetic correlations between some colour and skeletal traits. Consequently, phenotypic patterns were poor surrogates for genetic patterns and we suggest that this may be common if trade-offs or substantial parental effects exist. For this group of traits, the phenotypic gambit cannot be made and we suggest caution when inferring genetic patterns from phenotypic data, especially for behavioural and life-history traits.",not behavior,Cyanistes caeruleus,blue tits,Aves,cross fostering,cross-foster,"do phenotypic correlations match genetic correlations for traits with relatively low heritability? color traits had little heritable variation but common environment effects were important, skeletal traits were the opposite. didn't measure behavior, just color and morphology",no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,not human

We call these ""generalist genes"" to highlight their pervasive influence. In other words, most genes found to be associated with a particular learning ability or disability (such as reading) will also be associated with other learning abilities and disabilities (such as mathematics).

However, understanding the molecular basis of relevant traits is hampered by the paucity of passerine genomics tools. Efforts to address this problem are underway, and the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) will be the first passerine to have its genome sequenced. Here we describe a bioinformatic analysis of zebra finch expressed sequence tag (EST) Genbank entries.   Results: A total of 48,862 ESTs were downloaded from GenBank and assembled into contigs, representing an estimated 17,404 unique sequences. The unique sequence set contained 638 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or microsatellites of length = 20 bp and purity = 90% and 144 simple sequence repeats of length = 30 bp. A chromosomal location for the majority of SSRs was predicted by BLASTing against assembly 2.1 of the chicken genome sequence. The relative exonic location (5' untranslated region, coding region or 3' untranslated region) was predicted for 218 of the SSRs, by BLAST search against the ENSEMBL chicken peptide database. Ten loci were examined for polymorphism in two zebra finch populations and two populations of a distantly related passerine, the house sparrow Passer domesticus. Linkage was confirmed for four loci that were predicted to reside on the passerine homologue of chicken chromosome 7.   Conclusion: We show that SSRs are abundant within zebra finch ESTs, and that their genomic location can be predicted from sequence similarity with the assembled chicken genome sequence. We demonstrate that a useful proportion of zebra finch EST-SSRs are likely to be polymorphic, and that they can be used to build a linkage map. Finally, we show that many zebra finch EST-SSRs are likely to be useful in evolutionary genetic studies of other passerines.",description of zebra fincch ESTs. not relevant,Taeniopygia guttata,zebra finch,Aves,analyzed genome sequences,QTL mapping,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

However, both migration itself and flight capability reduce present reproductive success. Thus the long-term fitness benefit of migration, the colonization of new habitats, is balanced by a short-term reduction in fitness, the result being that variation for migratory ability is preserved in a population. Migration is but one component of a wide suite of functionally connected traits that together form a migratory syndrome. Genetic variation is found in all components of the migratory syndrome, and selection for migration results in a change in the frequency of expression of these components, which can be analyzed and predicted using the mathematics of quantitative genetics.

The scope of this article is to briefly review new findings on developmental iron deficiency and the persistence of deficiency effects into adulthood. A lack of sufficient iron intake may significantly delay the development of the central nervous system because of alterations in morphology, neurochemistry, and bioenergics. Depending on the stage of development at the time of iron deficiency, there may be an opportunity to reverse adverse effects, but the success of repletion efforts may be time dependent. The program project on ""Brain and Behavior in Early Iron Deficiency"" (B. Lozoff, P.I.) undertook preclinical and clinical studies to identify the regions of the brain and behaviors affected, and perhaps irreversibly altered, by early-life iron deficiency. Multiple outcomes are being measured in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents. Data in monkeys show significant effects on neurodevelopment with dietary iron deficiency. Findings in human infants are consistent with altered myelination and changes in monoamine functioning. Rodent studies show that effects of iron deficiency during gestation and lactation persist despite restoration of iron status at weaning.

Since its conception, TEDS has had as its focus the study of problematic development within the context of normal variation, mainly in the development of language, cognitive and academic abilities and behavior problems from multivariate quantitative and molecular genetic perspectives. TEDS twins have been assessed at 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10 and (currently) 12 years of age, and DNA collected from more than 12,000 children. Identified from birth records of twins born in the United Kingdom between 1994 and 1996, more than 15,000 pairs of twins originally enrolled in TEDS, and well over 13,000 pairs - representative of the UK population - remain involved in the study to date. Similar to many other twin and adoption studies, TEDS data indicate that both genetic and environmental influences are important in nearly all areas of behavioral development. Multivariate genetic analyses allow researchers to go beyond this basic nature-nurture question, and TEDS results suggest that, especially in the area of learning abilities and disabilities, genes are generalists and environments are specialists. That is, genes largely contribute to similarity in performance within and between learning abilities and disabilities and across age, whereas the environment contributes to differences in performance. Quantitative genetic findings such as these chart the course for molecular genetic research.

Survival and growth traits (height, diameter and polycyclism) and their relationship with environmental parameters were assessed to evaluate their adaptive value and establish patterns of variation of the species inside and outside its natural distribution area. The results showed a high level of ecotypic differentiation for survival. As a general pattern, seed sources from favourable environments exhibited lower survival rates at dry sites than those from harsh environments (r=-0.76, P<0.05, between survival and site index at the seed source). By contrast, growth traits presented a high phenotypic plasticity, scarce differentiation among seed sources and a negligible genotype x environment interaction. With few exceptions, local provenances from the Canary Islands did not stand out for survival or growth when compared with the rest at each trial site, whereas local seed sources from Israel were among the best growing and survived better at the experimental sites in this country.

A recent review by Lind and Cresswell (2005), however, noted some important difficulties with quantifying the fitness consequences of antipredator behaviors. In essence, Lind and Cresswell suggest that most studies do not provide strong evidence on the adaptive value of antipredator behavior because they do not consider 1) trade-offs between antipredator and reproductive performance, 2) the abilities of organisms to avoid fitness losses associated with constraints on focal traits by employing behavioral alternatives (behavioral compensation), and 3) the effects of behavioral defenses at different stages of the predation sequence. The authors rightfully assert that an understanding of these issues can only be accomplished by measuring multiple traits and fitness components (i.e., survival and reproduction). Nevertheless, the question of how to integrate such data into a coherent analysis of adaptive value was left unclear. Our discussion therefore has 2 main goals: 1) to illustrate how the concerns addressed by Lind and Cresswell can be unified and generalized to include a variety of other issues under the conceptual framework of phenotypic integration and 2) to describe 2 quantitative techniques that exist within that framework for addressing the question of adaptive value. We begin by reiterating the main points made by Lind and Cresswell with a hypothetical example (illustrated in Figure 1).",describe how to address issues in understanding the adaptive value of antipredator behavior,,,,review,,It's important to consider multiple traits ad fitness compnents - especially since that one trait can mask another trait.

Correlations among traits can allow behavioral syndromes to emerge. Constraints and trade offs are not the only means of generating individual differences.

Although quantitative genetics has successfully been applied to many traits, it does not provide a general theory accounting for interaction among individuals and selection acting on multiple levels. Consequently, Current quantitative genetic theory fails to explain why some traits do not respond to selection among individuals, but respond greatly to selection among groups. Understanding the full impacts of heritable interactions on the Outcomes of selection requires a quantitative genetic framework including all levels of selection and relatedness. Here we present such a framework and provide expressions for the response to selection. Results show that interaction among individuals may create substantial heritable variation, which is hidden to classical analyses. Selection acting on higher levels of organization captures this hidden variation and therefore always yields positive response, whereas individual selection may yield response in the opposite direction.

We apply these methods to obtain estimates of genetic parameters for survival, days in a population of layer chickens with high mortality due to pecking behavior. We find that heritable variation is threefold greater than that obtained from classical analyses, meaning that two-thirds of the full heritable variation is hidden to classical analysis due to social interactions. As a consequence, predicted responses to multilevel selection applied to this population are threefold greater than classical predictions.

The model makes use of monozygotic (MZ) twins who have identical heredity and dizygotic (DZ) twins who share half of their genes. From comparisons of intrapair differences between MZ & DZ twins we derive heritability (h(2)) estimates, which signify the extent to which heredity affects the variation of a given phenotype. There is accumulating evidence to show that individual differences in most functional abilities, morphological characteristics, motor attributes, personality and cognitive traits linked to superior sport performance are substantially influenced by genetic factors. H-2 reported by twin studies suggest that genetic influence is so ubiquitous and persuasive that we ask not what is heritable but what is not heritable. However a high h(2) of a given phenotype does not exclude environmental influence. Nature and Nurture are indeed inseparable and phenotypes reflect the effects of genes as well as those of epigenetic influences, the most potent of which is training. Training can produce results within the variability allowed by the genotype, but cannot erase individual differences which are due to innate ability. Deliberate effortful practice is a prerequisite for the actualization of an athletes genetic potential. If the environmental forces were optimized, the only decisive factor to peak sport performance would be the gentoype. Yet, though genes and training may set the biophysical limits to human performance, there is evidence that it is behavioral features which determine the ultimate frontiers of sport performance. The postulate that in addition to superior genotypes athletes of olympic caliber have also inherited genes which mediate a high response to training, is not tenable. To unravel the complex etiology of individual differences in sport performance we need to continue using techniques from quantitative genetics for the selection of candidate genes and tools from molecular genetics, now available, for identification of genes of performance phenotypes. Although there is a long way to go before we have a clear picture of the human gene map for sport performance traits, a number of laboratories and scientists concerned by the role of genes and DNA sequence variation in sport performance is rising.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Linear vs nonlinear is ignored in Tale of Two Matrices (Blows 2007) - do this by comparing models , which is not clear how to combine linear and rotated nonlinear terms in a single model. Diagonalization of gamma lets you look at nonlinear selection but does not help determine linear vs nonlinear. Selection gradients have direct relationship to quantitative genetic models, whereas canonical variates are less interpretable (even if they give us the selective surfaces). Trait integration typically occurs in pariwise correlations between traits because of our human constraints - matrix rotation can benefit a lot here - but it cannot tell us how or why traits interact. But what do we expect to happen to nonlinear selection - changes in skewness and kurtosis? how do patterns in loadings of traits on canonical variables change the predictions? The major question is whether selection alters genetic arcitecture or genetic architecture limits response to natural selection. How to compare matrices is still debated. Diagonalization can lead us to direct assessment of dimensionality of G to improve ability to assess constraints to adaptive evolution - but G is only an approximation itself of the covariance of breeding values and phenotypes and violations of assumptions, maternal effects or IGEs can render G less useful, and IGEs can allow for evolution in dimensions that lack direct genetic variance. Primary concerns: how new axes relate to original trait space and how we will interpret results based on the new axes. Selection does not necessarily target orthogonal axes of variation - but rotation of gamma circumvents this by describing shape of selection surface, but rotation of G creates the problem. And interpreting loadings is problematic because small loadings could contribute to correlational selection, and are they truly representative?

First, the FH/Wjd rat is compared with other Fawn-Hooded substrains (FH/Har, FHH/Eur, FHL/Eur) and it is concluded that only the FH/Wjd rat is both highly immobile in the forced swim test and drinks substantial amounts of 5-10% alcohol voluntarily. Next it is demonstrated that the FH/Wjd rat fulfils many of the criteria proposed for an animal model of alcoholism (becomes tolerant, becomes dependent and expresses withdrawal symptoms, bar-presses for alcohol). Other literature in addition to the high swim test immobility suggests that the FH/Wjd rat may also be an animal model of depression (high basal corticosterone levels, blunted hormonal responses to serotonergic agonists). To study the phenotypes more closely an inbred strain (ACI/N) of rat that drank little alcohol voluntarily and exhibited considerable swimming in the forced swim test (i.e., low immobility) was obtained. A systematic intercrossing of the parental strains and the resulting F1 progeny was carried out to generate more than 800 F2s. Swim test immobility, alcohol intake and preference and saccharin intake are four of the 7 variables assessed in each of these rats. Using classical quantitative genetics methods, it was determined that these four phenotypes exhibited modest heritability and were influenced by multiple genes. Correlation coefficients between immobility and the other measures were near zero, whereas alcohol intake and preference were highly correlated (r = 0.9) and alcohol and saccharin intakes were modestly correlated (r = 0.3). A final study showed that chronic fluoxetine treatment counteracted the high immobility but did not affect alcohol intake, similar to human studies.

We used the population in the construction of a high stringency genetic linkage map, consisting of 277 loci, for use in quantitative genetic analysis. A proportion of the markers had been used previously in the construction of linkage maps for Brassica species, thus permitting the alignment of maps. The map includes 68 newly developed Sequence Tagged Site (STS) markers targeted to the homologues of defined genes of A. thaliana. The use of these markers permits the alignment of our linkage map with the A. thaliana genome sequence. An additional 74 loci (31 newly developed STS markers and 43 loci defined by SSR and RFLP markers that had previously been used in published linkage maps) were added to the map. These markers increased the resolution of alignment of the newly constructed linkage map with existing Brassica linkage maps and the A. thaliana genome sequence. We conducted field trials with the TNDH population at two sites, and over 2 years, and identified reproducible QTL for seed oil content and erucic acid content.

Scientific examinations of these aspects presuppose genetic models. This paper presents an approach for modelling differentiation tasks in animal learning on a quantitative genetic basis. The approach links the likelihood function, to make a correct decision, with the two-dimensional density function, capable to be to decide right. The proposed model is able to depict several situations in learning processes of populations. Its parameters characterize the theoretical course of the learning process and also the stage of learning which a population has reached. The approach can be used to estimate parameters of a learning process and of the genetic disposition to learn, to estimate breeding values of learning capacity and to fit models on population's learning capability under selection.

Here, data are presented showing that this pattern holds for a wild population of lemur, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi). Using morphometric data collected on this population, it is shown that younger animals possess relatively large hands and feet. This ontogenetic pattern suggests a simple behavioral test: do juvenile animals with their larger, almost adult-sized hands and feet locomote on similarly sized substrates as adult animals? Using locomotor bout sampling, this question was tested by collecting positional behavior data on this population. Results from this test find no differences in locomotor behaviors or substrate use between yearlings and adult animals. To place these results in a broader evolutionary context, heritabilities and selection gradients of hands, feet, and other limb elements for animals in this population were estimated. Among limb elements, heritabilities range from 0.16-0.44, with the foot having the lowest value. Positive directional selection acts most strongly on the foot (directional selection gradient = 0.119). The low heritability and positive selection coefficient indicate that selection has acted, and continues to act, on foot size in young animals. These results are interpreted within a functional context with respect to the development of locomotor coordination: larger feet enable young animals to use ""adult-sized"" substrates when they move through their habitat. It is suggested that the widespread pattern of negative allometry of the extremities in sifaka and other primates is maintained by selection, and does not simply reflect a primitive developmental pathway that has no adaptive basis.",not behavior,Propithecus verreauxi,Verreaux's sifaka,Mammalia,collected positional behavior,,"do juvenile animals with their larger, almsot adult-sized hands and feet locomote on similarly sized substrates as adult animals? estimated heritabilities of limb elements, which had moderate heritabilities. didn't study quantitative genetics of behavior - though these morphological traits are related to behaviors",no,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,not human

In choice studies, tomato psyllids preferred to settle on plants that did not contain the gene [Moneymaker (mi-1.2)] compared to near-isogenic plants with the gene [Motelle (Mi-1.2)]. As a result, total oviposition was higher on the susceptible variety, although no-choice studies indicated that there were no differences in numbers of eggs laid by individual females on either variety. Survival from egg to adult was higher on plants lacking the gene compared to plants containing the gene. However, there were no differences in total development time of individuals reared from either variety.

In all but a few cases, the method of parentage assignment is divorced from the methods used to estimate the parameters of primary interest, such as mate choice or heritability. Here we present a Bayesian approach that simultaneously estimates the parentage of a sample of individuals and a wide range of population-level parameters in which we are interested. We show that joint estimation of parentage and population-level parameters increases the power of parentage assignment, reduces bias in parameter estimation, and accurately evaluates uncertainty in both. We illustrate the method by analysing a number of simulated test data sets, and through a re-analysis of parentage in the Seychelles warbler, Acrocephalus sechellensis. A combination of behavioural, spatial and genetic data are used in the analyses and, importantly, the method does not require strong prior information about the relationship between nongenetic data and parentage.","maybe useful for methods

This emerging research field has recently been supplemented by geographical studies concerned with the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis (FUSH), which states that population differences in genetic risk factors may partially account for conspicuous geographical patterns seen in suicide prevalence. In particular, the European high-suicide-rate nations constitute a contiguous, J-shaped belt, spanning from Finland to Austria. This area maps onto the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, most likely reflecting a major migration event of the past (i.e., the ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion) still detectable in modern European populations. The present research tested the hypothesis in the United States. Consistent with the hypothesis, available historical (1913-1924 and 1928-1932) U.S. state suicide rates were uniformly positively associated with available state proportions of reported American ancestries from European high-suicide-rate countries (Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the Ukraine). However, contrary to the hypothesis, available contemporary (1990-1994) suicide rates were uniformly negatively associated with these ancestry proportions. The findings of this first test outside Europe are therefore conflicting.

Is this ecological trade-off reflected at the population level as a negative genetic correlation between traits that contribute to growth and survival? We addressed this question for a single population of Green Frog tadpoles (Rana clamitans) by estimating heritabilities and correlations of traits that mediate the trade-off. Burst speed, growth rate, and size varied among sires and were significantly heritable, but swimming activity in the presence and absence of predator odors was not. Differences among traits in heritability generally accorded with differences in genetic coefficients of variation, with the exception of activity. Growth rate was not correlated with any measure of predator avoidance or escape ability. Likewise, predator escape ability (burst speed) was not correlated with predator avoidance ability (activity and its plasticity). Our results indicate that trait correlations observed among species may not be mirrored at the intraspecific level in the form of genetic correlations within a population.","burst speed, growth rate, and size varied among sires and were heritable but swimming activity was not.

There are examples, however, in which genetic correlations are not predictive of correlated responses. We examine how well a cross-environment genetic correlation predicts correlated responses to selection and the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in the seed beetle Stator limbatus. This beetle exhibits adaptive plasticity in egg size by laying large eggs on a resistant host and small eggs on a high-quality host. From a half-sib analysis, the cross-environment genetic correlation estimate was large and positive (r(A)=0.99). However, an artificial-selection experiment on egg size found that the realized genetic correlations were positive but asymmetrical; that is, they depended on both the host on which selection was imposed and the direction of selection. The half-sib estimate poorly predicted the evolution of egg size plasticity; plasticity evolved when selection was imposed on one host but did not evolve when selection was imposed on the other host. We use a simple two-locus additive genetic model to explore the conditions that can generate the observed realized genetic correlation and the observed pattern of plasticity evolution. Our model and experimental results indicate that the ability of genetic correlations to predict correlated responses to selection depends on the underlying genetic architecture producing the genetic correlation.",not behavior,Stator limbatus,seed beetle,Insecta,half-sib analysis,half-sib,egg size plasticity - not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,not human

The evidence presented so far is equivocal. The predicted relationship has been found in some morphological studies, but not in others. I propose that the variability of a character should be seen as different from the character itself. For most morphological characters, natural selection promotes strong canalization of development but, to facilitate responses to environmental changes, the organism needs to retain malleability of physiological and behavioral traits. These different types of selection should lead to distinct genetic architectures for these phenotypes. I report on the results of a diallel cross between four inbred mouse strains. Qualitatively different genetic architectures were in fact revealed for variation in behaviors in the open-field. In a second study, variances of inbred and hybrid populations for hippocampal morphometry were studied. Again, hybrids were not always less variable than inbreds and sometimes even more variable.

This paper focuses on the effects of escaped fanned Atlantic salmon (Sahno sular) on wild salmon. Farmed salmon have been under artificial selection for growth and other economically important traits for 30 years and are genetically different in their origin at the molecular and quantitative genetic levels. Escaped farmed salmon spawn in the wild with limited success. Their offspring outgrow those of wild origin but suffer higher mortality. Whole-river experiments in Ireland and Norway have shown that the lifetime success of farmed salmon is reduced relative to wild salmon. Based on data from these experiments, we model the future of wild salmon populations experiencing invasions of escaped fanned salmon. Simulations with a fixed intrusion rate of 20% escaped farmed salmon at spawning suggest that substantial changes take place in wild salmon populations within ten salmon generations (similar to 40 years). Low-invasion scenarios suggest that farmed offspring are unlikely to become established in the population, whereas high-invasion scenarios suggest that populations are eventually mixtures of hybrid and farmed descendants. Recovery of the wild population is not likely under all circumstances, even after many decades without further intrusion. Managers of wild salmon will have difficulty in obtaining broodstock of the original wild population after a few generations of high intrusion. We conclude that further measures to reduce escapes of fanned salmon and their spawning in wild populations are urgently needed. (c) 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

(Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), populations from Wooster and Celeryville, OH, with different average levels of larval tolerance. The adult behavioral response was measured as oviposition site preference and was investigated using full-sib design and parent-offspring regression. Additive genetic variance (0.134 +/- 0.02) and the heritability (h(2) = 0.31 +/- 0.08) for the behavioral response was significant for the Celeryville population, suggesting that in this population, a high proportion of phenotypic variation for adult behavioral response to permethrin was heritable genetic variation. The larval physiological response was measured with a topical application bioassay and was investigated using a half-sib design. Significant additive genetic variances and heritabilities for physiological tolerance to permethrin were detected in both populations. The genetic correlation between adult behavioral response and larval physiological tolerance to permethrin were negative, but significant only in the Celeryville population; indicating that adults from this population that are more behaviorally responsive produced offspring that are more susceptible to permethrin. Our findings have implications for the evolution and management of insecticide resistance in the diamondback moth. The adult behavioral response can lower the exposure of larvae to the insecticide, lowering selection pressure for physiological resistance in larvae. Furthermore, to the extent that the adult behavioral response increases fitness, it can indirectly select for larval susceptibility because of the negative correlation between the two traits.",heritability of behavioral and physiological responses to insecticide,Plutella xylostella,diamondback moth,Insecta,"full-sib design and parent-offspring regression

For two of these genes, QTL and expression data were completely concordant with respect to directionality of effects: high mating success was associated with high levels of gene expression and with beneficial QTL effects on the trait.

Whereas precopulatory and post-copulatory sexual selection has been invoked to explain this trend, the functional significance of genital structures during copulation remains obscure. We used time-sequence analysis to study the functional significance of external genitalic structures during the course of copulation, between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. This functional analysis has provided new information that reveals the importance of male-driven copulatory mechanics and strategies in the rapid diversification of genitalia. The posterior process, which is a recently evolved sexual character and present only in males of the melanogaster clade, plays a crucial role in mounting as well as in genital coupling. Whereas there is ample evidence for precopulatory and/or post-copulatory female choice, we show here that during copulation there is little or no physical female choice, consequently, males determine copulation duration. We also found subtle differences in copulatory mechanics between very closely related species. We propose that variation in male usage of novel genitalic structures and shifts in copulatory behaviour have played an important role in the diversification of genitalia in species of the Drosophila subgroup.",not relevant,,,,,,,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Maximal sprinting performance was measured in a series of wild-caught adult collared lizards (Crotaphytus collaris) from a single Oklahoma population. Sprint speed varied repeatably among individuals, but did not scale to body size among adults. Contrary to our first prediction, sprint speed did not differ between sexes. However, among 11 adult males sprint speed was strongly correlated to territory size and a spatial index of potential mating success (independent of body size), which indicates phenotypic intrasexual selection, whether direct or indirect, for whole-animal locomotor performance. The lack of sexual dimorphism in sprint speed may reflect trade-offs with other sexually selected traits (e.g., head size) and/or condition-dependence of running capability. Sexual selection of social behavior may underlie more generally the evolution of physiological performance, and therefore of suborganismal physiology and morphology.",maximal sprint speed was measured in wild caught individuals and was correlated to territory size -- not quantitative genetics,Crotaphytus collaris,collared lizards,Reptilia,measured sprint speed in wild animals,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

The biochemical differences between these two classes of pigment, together with their different physiological roles, have led to the general belief that there will be a fundamental difference in the way in which they are used in animal signals. Specifically, it has been argued that carotenoid-based colours will have higher levels of condition dependence and that melanin-based traits will be under tighter genetic control. We present a meta-analysis of studies that have experimentally investigated the signalling quality of the two kinds of colour in birds and show that there is no evidence of a difference between them. Furthermore, we show that the available data are currently very limited, both in the number of studies and in the quality of many of the studies that have attempted to examine this question, and we suggest directions for future work.

For migration to be successful, many different aspects of an animal's physiology and behaviour need to function in a co-coordinated way. Changes in one migratory trait are therefore likely to be accompanied by changes in other migratory and life-history traits. At present, we have some knowledge of the pressures that operate at the various stages of migration, but we know very little about the extent of genetic variation in various aspects of the migratory syndrome. As a consequence, our ability to predict which species is capable of what kind of evolutionary change, and at which rate, is limited. Here, we review how our evolutionary understanding of migration may benefit from taking a quantitative-genetic approach and present a framework for studying the causes of phenotypic variation. We review past research, that has mainly studied single migratory traits in captive birds, and discuss how this work could be extended to study genetic variation in the wild and to account for genetic correlations and correlated selection. In the future, reaction-norm approaches may become very important, as they allow the study of genetic and environmental effects on phenotypic expression within a single framework, as well as of their interactions. We advocate making more use of repeated measurements on single individuals to study the causes of among-individual variation in the wild, as they are easier to obtain than data on relatives and can provide valuable information for identifying and selecting traits. This approach will be particularly informative if it involves systematic testing of individuals under different environmental conditions. We propose extending this research agenda by using optimality models to predict levels of variation and covariation among traits and constraints. This may help us to select traits in which we might expect genetic variation, and to identify the most informative environmental axes. We also recommend an expansion of the passerine model, as this model does not apply to birds, like geese, where cultural transmission of spatio-temporal information is an important determinant of migration patterns and their variation.",advocate for reaction norm approach in study of migration,,,,review,,"migration would benefit from quantitative genetic approach and the multivariate framework, including reaction norm approaches",no,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART B-MOLECULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL   EVOLUTION," Salazar-Ciudad, IAF Salazar-Ciudad, I", Developmental constraints vs. variational properties: How pattern   formation can help to understand evolution and development, 306B,2006," This article suggests that apparent disagreements between the concept of developmental constraints and neo-Darwinian views on morphological evolution can disappear by using a different conceptualization of the interplay between development and selection. A theoretical framework based on current evolutionary and developmental biology and the concepts of variational properties, developmental patterns and developmental mechanisms is presented. In contrast with existing paradigms, the approach in this article is specifically developed to compare developmental mechanisms by the morphological variation they produce and the way in which their functioning can change due to genetic variation. A developmental mechanism is a gene network, which is able to produce patterns in space though the regulation of some cell behaviour (like signalling, mitosis, apoptosis, adhesion, etc.). The variational properties of a developmental mechanism are all the pattern transformations produced under different initial and environmental conditions or IS-mutations. IS-mutations are DNA changes that affect how two genes in a network interact, while T-mutations are mutations that affect the topology of the network itself. This article explains how this new framework allows predictions not only about how pattern formation affects variation, and thus phenotypic evolution, but also about how development evolves by replacement between pattern formation mechanisms. This article presents testable inferences about the evolution of the structure of development and the phenotype under different selective pressures. That is what kind of pattern formation mechanisms, in which relative temporal order, and which kind of phenotypic changes, are expected to be found in development.",not behavior,,,,,,not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Across age classes, minimum and maximum mean titers (ng +/- SE) of Z9,E12-14:Ac and Z9-14:Ac ranged from 8.7 +/- 0.46 to 21 +/- 1.0 and from 2.0 +/- 0.14 to 2.9 +/- 0.15, respectively; the mean ratio of Z9,E12-14:Ac to Z9-14:Ac ranged from 5.2 +/- 0.21 to 11 +/- 0.40. The titers of Z9,E12-14:Ac and Z9-14:Ac and the ratio of Z9,E12-14:Ac to Z9-14:Ac were highest at the onset of the scotophase and lowest at the onset of the photophase. Similarly, the titer of Z9,E12-14:Ac and the ratio of Z9,E12-14:Ac to Z9-14:Ac were highest in females sampled 1 d postemergence and declined over all age classes. The titer of Z9-14:Ac increased from day 1 to day 2, and then declined to levels equivalent to day 1. Analysis of pupal and adult mass demonstrated a positive correlation (r = 0.874, P < 0.001); however, the titer of neither Z9,E12-14:Ac or Z9-14:Ac nor the ratio of Z9,E12-14:Ac to Z9-14:Ac were significantly correlated with pupal mass. Age-related variations in pheromone titer and ratios were heritable. The narrow-sense heritability of the observed variation in 1-d-old females, 1 hr into the scotophase is 1.2 +/- 0.32, 0.75 +/- 0.24, and 0.46 +/- 0.17 for the titer of Z9,E12-14:Ac and Z9-14:Ac and the ratio of Z9,E12-14:Ac to Z9-14:Ac, respectively.

The codling moth Cydia poinonella, one of the most important pest insects of apple fruit orchards worldwide, is regarded as a 'sedentary' insect, but the natural populations consist of both mobile and sedentary genotypes that display different dispersal capacity in the field. The current study investigated whether there is a fitness consequence of being mobile in this species by comparing two strains with contrasting levels of mobility obtained through bi-directional selection.   2. Female moths of the sedentary strain were significantly larger, laid more eggs during their lifespan, and both male and female moths of this strain lived longer, when compared with the mobile strain.   3. The age-specific fecundity of female moths from the sedentary strain was significantly greater, in particular between 3 and 5 days after emergence when the peaks of both oviposition and flight capacity occur, relative to the mobile moths, thereby leading to a greater reproductive function. 4. These differences resulted in different demographic parameters between the two strains. The sedentary strain had a significantly greater net reproductive rate (R-o) and a higher intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)), although the generation time (7) was similar, hence requiring a shorter time to double the population size, in comparison to the mobile strain.   5. This study provides empirical evidence for the cost of being mobile in C. poinonella. Trade-offs between mobility and Fitness might have contributed to the existence of genetic variance for dispersal behaviour in the natural populations and the maintenance of relative sedentariness in the species.","sedentary strains are larger, lay more eggs, and live longer - there's a cost to mobility",Cydia poinonella,codling moth,Insecta,comparing two strains,selection lines,not precisely quantitative genetics - an example of trade-offs between life history and mobility,probably not,,,,,,,,x,,x,,,,,,,,not human

It is important therefore that these metals be closely regulated. We recently conducted a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis to identify chromosomal regions in the mouse containing possible regulatory genes. The animals came from 15 strains of the BXD/Ty recombinant inbred (RI) strain panel and the brain regions analyzed were frontal cortex, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens and ventral midbrain. Several QTL were identified for copper and/or zinc, most notably on chromosomes 1, 8, 16 and 17. Genetic correlational analysis also revealed associations between these metals and dopamine, cocaine responses, saccharine preference, immune response and seizure susceptibility. Notably, the QTL on chromosome 17 is also associated with seizure susceptibility and contains the histocompatibility H2 complex. This work shows that regulation of zinc and copper is under polygenic influence and is intimately related to CNS function. Future work will reveal genes underlying the QTL and how they interact with other genes and the environment. More importantly, revelation of the genetic underpinnings of copper and zinc brain homeostasis will aid our understanding of neurological diseases that are related to copper and zinc imbalance.",not behavior,,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

However, individual behavioural traits do not evolve independently of each other (behavioural syndromes). A prime example is the suite of behavioural differences in honeybee workers that has evolved in response to bidirectional selection on pollen hoarding of honeybee colonies (pollen-hoarding syndrome). More generally, these differences reflect functional differentiation between nectar and pollen foragers. We demonstrate here that this pollen-hoarding syndrome extends to drones. Similar to what has been shown in workers, drones from the high-pollen-hoarding strain had a higher locomotion activity after emergence, and they initiated flight earlier than did males derived from the low-pollen-hoarding strain, with hybrids intermediate. However, these two behavioural traits were unlinked at the individual level. We also found that social environment (the colony) affects the age at which drones initiate flight. The indirect selection responses of male behaviour suggest that male and worker evolution are not independent and may constrain each other's evolution. Furthermore, we identified three distinct peaks in the probability of flight initiation over the course of the experiment and a decreased phenotypic variability in the 'hybrid' males, contrary to quantitative genetic expectations.

 J, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES," Forstmeier, WAF Forstmeier, W", Quantitative genetics and behavioural correlates of digit ratio in the   zebra finch,272,2005," A recent study on a captive zebra finch population suggested that variation in digit ratio (i.e. the relative length of the second to the fourth toe) might be an indicator of the action of sex steroids during embryo development, as is widely assumed for human digits. Zebra finch digit ratio was found to vary with offspring sex, laying order of eggs within a clutch, and to predict aspects of female mating behaviour. Hence, it was proposed that the measurement of digit ratio would give insights into how an individual's behaviour is shaped by its maternal environment. Studying 500 individuals of a different zebra finch population I set out to: (1) determine the proximate causes of variation in digit ratio by means of quantitative genetics and (2) to search for phenotypic and genetic correlations between digit ratio, sexual behaviour and aspects of fitness. In contrast to the earlier study, I found no sexual dimorphism in digit ratio and no effect of either laying order or experimentally altered hatching order on digit ratio. Instead, I found that variation in digit ratio was almost entirely additive genetic, with heritability estimates ranging from 71 to 84%. The rearing environment (from egg deposition to independence) explained an additional 5-6% of the variation in digit ratio, but there was no indication of any maternal effects transmitted through the egg. I found highly significant phenotypic correlations (and genetic correlations of similar size) between digit ratio and male song rate (positive correlation) as well as between digit ratio and female hopping activity in a choice chamber (negative correlation). Rather surprisingly, the strength of these correlations differed significantly between subsequent generations of the same population, illustrating how quickly such correlations can appear and disappear probably due to genotype-environment interactions.","correlations changed between generations, and there were correlations between morphology and behavior",Taeniopygia guttata,zebra finch,Aves,quantitative genetics,cross-foster,"variation in digit ratio was almost entirely additive genetic.

We wished to know whether selection generated by pollinators acted directly or indirectly on floral rewards, on advertisement traits, and/or traits affecting pollinator efficiency (their fit with flowers) in Dalechampia vines (Euphorbiaceae) and whether the advertisement (bract size) was correlated honestly with reward amount (measured by resin-gland area). In Gabon we studied bee visitation and pollen arrival rates to blossoms of D. ipomoefolia Benth. and found that, despite the apparent visibility of the resin reward (and its volume), the strongest bee-mediated natural selection acted directly on bract size rather than gland area. Blossoms with larger bracts were visited more often by the only pollinators, female Heriades nr. spiniscutis (Apoidea: Megachilidae), and these blossoms received more pollen on their stigmas. Blossoms with larger resin glands were also visited more often and received more pollen overall, but this effect disappeared when bract size (which was phenotypically correlated with gland size) was controlled for statistically. These observational data were confirmed by experimental reduction of bract size, which significantly decreased pollen arrival rates. Thus, the bees appear to rely on the ""honest'' correlation between advertisement and reward in choosing the best blossoms to visit, and this behavior generates direct selection for larger bracts and indirect selection for larger resin glands. Bees visiting blossoms with larger separation between the gland and stigmas contacted the stigmas less frequently, and such blossoms received less pollen on their stigmas. Because gland area, bract size, and gland-stigma separation are positively correlated phenotypically, response to selection for larger bracts may be limited in this population by conflicting selection against large gland-stigma separation.",plants,,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

 J, REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL," Vargas, AOAF Vargas, AO", Beyond selection,78,2005," It has been argued that the study of natural selection and quantitative genetics should have a central role in evolutionary thinking and undergraduate teaching in Chile. Extensive operational use of the concept of natural selection may seem consistent with this argument. However, advances of evolutionary knowledge in independent fields such as phylogenetic analysis, developmental evolution. and paleontology cannot be ignored. I argue here that the role of natural selection in contemporary evolutionary biology can be compared to that of Newtonian mechanics in contemporary physics: it can describe a given domain of observations, but it is insufficient to handle the different sources of evolutionary knowledge. Overemphasis on natural selection as the immediate mechanism of evolution may lead to disregard phylogenetic-historical evidence, and to ignore the important evolutionary role of non-adaptive change and epigenetic phenotypic plasticity. Natural selection deals with populations and leads to conceive the environment as a ""sieve"" of genetic variation. bypassing the role of the environment as a trigger of phenotypic and behavioral diversification. Alternatively, it is possible to conceive how part of the medium participates as an ontogenic niche in the trans-reproductive change or conservation of an ontogenic phenotype. The concept of drift, currently accepted for molecular and developmental change. can be applied to the level of the phenotype as an alternative to the concept of evolution as adaptation by natural selection.",not relevant,,,,position paper,,"argue against adaptationist paradigm, comparing natural selection to Newtonian mechanics -- insufficent to handle different sources of evolutioanry knowledge",no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Here, we explore the molecular genetic basis of the opening and closing lever mechanisms of the cichlid lower jaw, which have traditionally been used to describe the mechanics of feeding behavior in bony fishes. Quantitative genetic analyses demonstrate that the opening and closing mechanisms are genetically modular and therefore free to evolve independently. Bmp4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4) is one of two loci that segregate with the mechanical advantage of closing and that together account for > 30% of the phenotypic variance in this trait. Species-specific differences in jaw shape are obvious early in cichlid larval development and are correlated with patterns of bmp4 expression in the mandibular primordium. When bmp4 is overexpressed in the obligate suction feeder Danio rerio, mandibular morphology exhibits specific transformations of opening and closing lever ratios. We conclude that patterns of morphological integration of the cichlid jaw reflect a balance among conflicting functional demands. Further, we demonstrate that bmp4 has the potential to alter mandibular morphology in a way that mimics adaptive variation among fish species.",not behavior,Cichlidae,cichlid,Actinopterygii,quantiative genetic analysis,,looked at open and closing mechanisms of cichlid jaw - not actually behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, CURRENT SCIENCE," Joshi, AAF Joshi, A", Behaviour genetics in the post-genomics era: From genes to behaviour and   vice versa,89,2005," Approaches to understanding behaviour in an evolutionary context can be grouped into two broad categories: behaviour genetics and behavioural ecology. In this paper, I briefly discuss the development of these two fields, to highlight some serious shortcomings in their focus and/or approach to understanding behaviour. These shortcomings have been pointed out by numerous researchers before, but it seems to be an opportune time to revisit this issue because present day methods are making it increasingly likely that some of these gaps in our understanding of behaviour can now be addressed experimentally. Early behaviour genetics essentially led to neurogenetics due to its focus on single-gene mutations affecting behaviour, which were often mutations affecting the nervous system. This line of work, consequently, diverged considerably from the study of behaviour per se and, although it contributed a great deal to our understanding of how the components of the nervous system work, it did not really shed much light on behaviour at the organismal level. More recent approaches in behaviour genetics include quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, which is an attempt to go beyond the black box approach of classical quantitative genetics and to track down loci mediating behavioural differences among individuals. Behavioural ecology provided a counter point to traditional behaviour genetics by explicitly focusing on ultimate causes, and trying to understand behaviour in terms of its adaptive (fitness) value. However, behavioural ecology too has at its core a conceptual lacuna, which is the absence of knowledge of the genotype-to-phenotype mapping for most behavioural traits. This conceptual lacuna is serious, and it affects not just behavioural ecology but most attempts to understand the evolutionary dynamics of complex and composite phenotypes that are, in terms of gene expression, far removed from the genome. What I have to say, therefore, applies broadly to attempts to understand the evolutionary shaping of complex phenotypes, and not just to studies of behaviour. I suggest that we really need a new and enlarged conception of, and approach to, behaviour genetics; an approach that will utilize recent advances in genetic technology, but yet be rooted in a holistic, organismal weltanschaung. I briefly describe some examples of this approach that I believe highlight the potential that this new behaviour genetics has to enrich and round off our understanding of behaviour from an evolutionary perspective.",behavioral genetics vs behavioral ecology,,,,review,,need a new and enlarged conception of behavior genetics that uses new genetic technoology but is rooted in the organism.

We found a significant repeatability of nest site choice, suggesting that this behaviour is heritable and may show the potential for further evolution. By looking at possible consequences of nest site choice, we found that hatching success was similar among different beach zones, but the ability of hatchlings to emerge from the nest was impaired in areas subject to tidal inundation. Sea-finding tests showed that hatchlings were more susceptible to disorientation in areas deeper in the forest. Maintaining phenotypic diversity in nest site choice could derive from variation in the environment, where a constantly shifting balance between phenotypes would be promoted by environmental change over time. Alternatively, the different nesting behaviours could be maintained though frequency-dependent selection. Phenotypic sex of sea turtle embryos is determined by the incubation temperature of the nests, and different beach zones have different thermal properties. Females that nest in areas that produce the rarer sex may therefore gain a fitness advantage. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the last century, guppies, Poecilia reticulata, repeatedly invaded streams in Australia and elsewhere. Quantitative genetic studies of one Australian guppy population have demonstrated high additive genetic variation for autosomal and Y-linked morphological traits. The combination of colonization success, high heritability of morphological traits, and the possibility of multiple introductions to Australia raised the prediction that neutral genetic diversity is high in introduced populations of guppies. In this study we examine genetic diversity at nine microsatellite and one mitochondrial locus for seven Australian populations. We used mtDNA haplotypes from the natural range of guppies and from domesticated varieties to identify source populations. There were a minimum of two introductions, but there was no haplotype diversity within Australian populations, suggesting a founder effect. This was supported by microsatellite markers, as allelic diversity and heterozygosity were severely reduced compared to one wild source population, and evidence of recent bottlenecks was found. Between Australian populations little differentiation of microsatellite allele frequencies was detected, suggesting that population admixture has occurred historically, perhaps due to male-biased gene flow followed by bottlenecks. Thus success of invasion of Australia and high additive genetic variance in Australian guppies are not associated with high levels of diversity at molecular loci. This finding is consistent with the release of additive genetic variation by dominance and epistasis following inbreeding, and with disruptive and negative frequency-dependent selection on fitness traits.",not quantitative genetics,Poecilia reticulata,Trinidadian guppies,Actinopterygii,genetic diversity,,no relationship between modlecular loci diversity and high additive genetic variance,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, BEHAVIOR GENETICS," Carey, GAF Carey, G", Cholesky problems,35,2005," Behavioral geneticists commonly parameterize a genetic or environmental covariance matrix as the product of a lower diagonal matrix postmultiplied by its transpose-a technique commonly referred to as ""fitting a Cholesky."" Here, simulations demonstrate that this procedure is sometimes valid, but at other times: (1) may not produce fit statistics that are distributed as a chi(2); or (2) if the distribution of the fit statistic is chi(2) stop, then the degrees of freedom (df) are not always the difference between the number of parameters in the general model less the number of parameters in a constrained model. It is hypothesized that the problem is related to the fact that the Cholesky parameterization requires that the covariance matrix formed by the product be either positive definite or singular. Even though a population covariance matrix may be positive definite, the combination of sampling error and the derived-as opposed to directly observed-nature of genetic and environmental matrices allow matrices that are negative (semi) definite. When this occurs, fitting a Cholesky constrains the numerical area of search and compromises the maximum likelihood theory currently used in behavioral genetics. Until the reasons for this phenomenon are understood and satisfactory solutions are developed, those who fit Cholesky matrices face the burden of demonstrating the validity of their fit statistics and the df for model comparisons. An interim remedy is proposed-fit an unconstrained model and a Cholesky model, and if the two differ, then report the difference in fit statistics and parameter estimates. Cholesky problems are a matter of degree, not of kind. Thus, some Cholesky solutions will differ trivially from the unconstrained solutions, and the importance of the problems must be assessed by how often the two lead to different substantive interpretation of the results. If followed, the proposed interim remedy will develop a body of empirical data to assess the extent to which Cholesky problems are important substantive issues versus statistical curiosities.",all about Choesky parameterization of ccovariancce matrix,,,,stats,,statistical and matehmatical considerations of covariance matrices. much too in-the-weeds for the chapter,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Indirect genetic effects models simultaneously consider zygotic genes, genes expressed in social partners (especially mothers and siblings), and the interactions between them. Incorporation of these diverse genetic effects should lead to more realistic models of social evolution. We first review haplodiploidy as a factor that promotes the evolution of eusociality. Social insect biologists have doubted the importance of relatedness asymmetry caused by hoplodiploidy and focused on other predisposing factors such as maternal care. However, indirect effects theory shows that maternal care evolves more readily in haplodiploids, especially with inbreeding and despite multiple mating. Because extended maternal care is believed to be a precondition for the evolution of eusociality, the evolutionary bias towards maternal care in haplodiploids may result in a further bias towards eusocialily in these groups. Next, we compare kin selection and parental manipulation and then briefly review additional hypotheses for the evolutionary origin of eusociality. We present a verbal model for the evolutionary origin and elaboration of sib-social care from maternal care based on the modification of the timing of expression of maternal care behaviors. Specifically, heterochrony genes cause maternal care behaviors to be expressed prereproductively towards siblings instead of postreproductively towards offspring. Our review demonstrates that both maternal effect genes (expressed in a parental manipulation manner) and direct effect zygotic genes (expressed in an offspring control manner) are likely involved in the evolution of eusociality. We conclude by describing theoretical and empirical advances with indirect genetic effects and sociogenomics, and me provide specific quantitative genetic and genomic predictions from our heterochrony model for the evolutionary origin and elaboration of eusociality.",review origin and elaboration of sociality in an indirect genetics effect perspective,,,,review,,"might be a useful overview for social behaviors (eusociality, kin selection,etc)",maybe,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,x,,not human

Phylogenetic analysis revealed a sister relationship between the generalist Stator limbatus and the specialist host-shifted Stator beali, providing a system to examine the genealogical and geographic origins of the main processes involved in this diversification: host-shifts, specialization, and reproductive isolation. We examine the interspecific phylogeographic relationships between these species using mitochondrial DNA sequence data. S. beali is derived within S. limbatus, rendering the latter paraphyletic and suggesting a budding process of speciation. The inherent polarity in this genealogical pattern indicates that the specialist habit, clumping oviposition behavior, and distinct genitalia of S. beali are all derived from the ancestral S. limbatus. The phylogeography of S. limbatus also shows strong geographic structure with divergences corresponding to known biogeographic boundaries, indicating that this evolutionary signal has not been erased by the vagaries of history. However, the derivation of S. beali and the evolution of reproductive isolation between the two species does not correspond to these known biogeographic boundaries, as S. beali and its sister clade of S. limbatus are restricted to the same geographic province. The geographic proximity of diversification combined with a divergence time estimated at the beginning of the Pleistocene indicates that speciation likely occurred very rapidly, although further genetic and ecological work is necessary to examine the mode of speciation. This study provides the historical context for ongoing evolutionary, ecological, and quantitative genetic research on the divergence in diet breadth between these species. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that using these endophenotypes would provide more power to detect linkage than the diagnosis of autism. Previously, we reported results for a nonparametric quantitative trait locus (QTL) genome scan in 152 families with autism, which revealed a linkage peak related to spoken language on 7q35. Here, we present the results of a nonparametric QTL scan of autism endophenotypes in 291 multiplex families, including the original 152. The strongest evidence for an 'age at first word' QTL was on chromosomes 3q at 147 cM ( Z = 3.10, P<0.001), and 17q at 93 cM ( Z = 2.84, P = 0.002), both represent novel susceptibility loci for autism endophenotypes. There was also support for a previously identified autism peak on chromosome 17 at 43 cM ( Z = 2.22, P = 0.013) with 'age at first phrase'. The 7q35 language peak was attenuated ( Z = 2.05, P = 0.02) compared with the original finding. To explore the possibility of increased heterogeneity resulting from the addition of 135 families to the sample, we conducted an Ordered-Subsets Analysis on chromosome 7; these results suggest that the 132 autism families with the earliest average age at first word are responsible for the QTL on 7q35.

Several studies have attempted to identify possible consequences of undergoing ART on the subsequent offspring. However, most studies have only included singleton births. We first examined whether twins born by ART differed from other twins on measures of childhood psychopathology, putative risk factors and correlates, and secondly tested for differences in the degree of twin similarity for available outcome measures. From a population-based twin sample, 101 families with dizygotic (DZ) twins conceived via ART were identified and compared with 1073 naturally conceived (NC) control DZ twin pairs. Analyses performed were (1) univariate and multivariate comparisons of between-group mean differences; and (2) comparison of twin 1-twin 2 correlations between the groups. The groups differed significantly on demographic factors (parental age, family size and social class) and pregnancy variables (smoking during pregnancy and birthweight) but did not differ on family conflict scores or in the frequency of obstetric complications. Family cohesion was higher in the ART group but this was accounted for by demographic factors. For child psychopathology there was a difference between the groups only for teacher-rated ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Differences were also found between groups for twin correlations.

We repeatedly scanned replicated groups of genetically identical individuals, five females and five males, and recorded the behavior of each individual (i.e., walking, feeding, grooming, flying, courting, mating, fighting, or resting). From these behaviors, we made a composite variable of activity for-our quantitative genetic analysis. Genotypes differed in activity, explaining 14.41% of the variation in activity; 8.60% of the variation was explained by a significant genotype X sex interaction, which signifies genetic variation for sexual dimorphism in behavior. Phenotypic plasticity explained 11.13% of the variation in activity. Different genotypes and sexes within genotypes had different rank orders of the component behaviors that contribute to activity. We found no effect of common rearing environment. Instead, differences between replicate groups within genotype accounted for 19.47% variation in activity, and activity was significantly repeatable across scans. This emergent group behavior is likely caused by differences between groups of interacting individuals, even though individuals were genetically identical across groups. Thus, emergent group behavior explained almost as much variation in activity as the combined sources of genetic variation (23.01%), and this is an additional level on which selection could operate: individuals and groups. We discuss how differences among groups could change patterns of additive genetic variation available for evolution. Furthermore, because the behavior of an individual is influenced by conspecifics, genotype interactions between individuals could contribute to indirect selection. Finally, if we consider activity as a syndrome governing all component behaviors with strong genetic correlations among behaviors within an individual, then these component behaviors cannot evolve independently. These results suggest that reductionist approaches of molecular behavior genetics may be incomplete and/or misleading when considering similar phenotypes at the population level or when trying to understand how behaviors evolve.",genotypes varied in activity,Drosophila melanogaster,fruit fly,Insecta,isogenic lines,inbred full-sib,found that emergent group behavior explained alost as much variation as genetic variation -- IGEs are important. consider activity as a syndrome,probably not,x,,,,,x,,x,,x,,,,,,x,,not human

However, its aquatic/terrestrial biphasic life cycle, together with remarkable differences in salinity tolerance between Spanish and UK freshwater populations suggest an alternative hypothesis to local adaptation. Drought resistance during the terrestrial phase and salinity tolerance during the aquatic phase are both related to osmotic stress tolerance, and if there were an association between them, one could have evolved as an exaptation from the other. To test such an association, we reared B. calamita juveniles from three populations known to differ genetically in their salinity tolerance, under either dry or humid conditions. Drought decreased growth rate, enhanced burying behaviour, and decreased foraging activity and efficiency. No significant population x treatment interaction was found for any variable, i.e. populations were equally affected by drought.

Using a half-sib design, I examined the narrow-sense heritability of predator-induced behaviour, morphology, and life history in larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica). Many of the traits had significant additive genetic variation in predator (caged Anax longipes) and no-predator environments. Whereas most traits had moderate to high heritability across environments, tail depth exhibited high heritability with predators but low heritability without predators. In addition, several traits had significant heritability for plasticity, suggesting a potential for selection to act on plasticity per se. Genetic correlations confirmed known phenotypic relationships across environments and identified novel relationships within each environment. This appears to be the first investigation of narrow-sense heritabilities for predator-induced traits and confirms that inducible traits previously shown to be under selection also have a genetic basis and should be capable of exhibiting evolutionary responses.",additive genetic variation found in predator and no-predator environments,Rana sylvatica,wood frogs,Amphibia,half-sib design,half-sib,"most traits had moderate to high heritability across all environments, including heritability for plasticity. identified genetic correlations among traits",skim,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,not human

The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis provides a potential mechanism for reliable signalling in the form of a trade-off between expenditure on trait expression and expenditure on immunity. Thus, males resistant to disease can spend more resources on their sexual signals. Examination of calling song parameters in a natural population of the cricket Teleogryllus commodus revealed that males scoring higher on the third principal component for song had significantly lower ability to encapsulate a foreign object. This component of immune function was associated with syllables of longer duration in both the trill and chirp elements of the song. Males with longer syllables in their song had a lower encapsulation ability. Syllable duration is known to influence phonotaxis by female T. commodus. Although the effect was only weak, our data suggest that females may base their choice of mate on reliable information contained within the temporal properties of male calls. Our study thus demonstrates a connection between sexual signalling and immune function in a natural population of insects and lends support to the. immunocompetence handicap hypothesis.

The goals of the present study were 1) to confirm, in two parallel population-based samples, including a large sample of twins, the factor structure of a new self-administered questionnaire assessing both parents' specific parenting perceptions and behaviours toward their 5-month-old infants (i.e., parental self-efficacy, perceived parental impact, parental hostile-reactive behaviours and parental overprotection), 2) to identify the specific risk factors associated with the negative side of these parenting dimensions, 3) to document the genetic-environmental etiology of these parenting dimensions through the twin method. Methods: Parents (2,122 mothers and 1,829 fathers) of 5-month-old infants, and parents of 5-month-old infant twins (510 families) completed the questionnaire (28 items). The data were submitted to a series of confirmatory factor analyses. The contribution to parenting of a variety of risk factors was examined in the two samples using regression analyses. A series of quantitative genetic analyses were performed to quantify the different sources of variation in parenting. Results: A consistent factor structure was found across informants and across samples. There were significant mean differences in parenting between mothers and fathers, as well as between parents of twins and parents of singletons. A differentiated pattern of association with risk factors was found for each dimension of parenting. The twin analyses revealed that shared environment accounted for each parenting dimension. Maternal hostile-reactive behaviours were also moderately related to genetic factors in the child and this association was mainly mediated by the infant difficultness. Conclusions: The overall pattern of results was consistent with Belsky's (1984) view of parenting as multiply determined.

 J, JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY," Reluga, TC   Viscido, SAF Reluga, TC   Viscido, S", Simulated evolution of selfish herd behavior,234,2005," Single species aggregations are a commonly observed phenomenon. One potential explanation for these aggregations is provided by the selfish herd hypothesis, which states that aggregations result from individual efforts to reduce personnel predation risk at the expense of group-mates. Not all movement rules based on the selfish herd hypothesis are consistent with observed animal behavior. Previous work has shown that herd-like aggregations are not generated by movement rules limited to local interactions between nearest neighbors. Instead, rules generating realistic herds appear to require delocalized interactions. To date, it has been an open question whether or not the necessary delocalization can emerge from local interactions under natural selection. To address this question, we study an individual-based model with a single quantitative genetic trait that controls the influence of neighbors as a function of distance. The results indicate that predation-based selection can increase the influence of distant neighbors relative to near neighbors. Our results lend support for the idea that selfish herd behavior can arise from localized movement rules under natural selection. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Because engaging in extrapair copulations (EPCs) is believed to be costly for females, it has been argued that EPC behavior must bring indirect benefits to females by elevating offspring fitness. We use empirical data from the literature to assess the relative strength of indirect and direct selection on female EPC behavior, using quantitative genetic approximations of selection. This analysis confirmed that there is generally negative direct selection on EPC behavior caused by depressed paternal investment by social males. In contrast, there was no significant positive indirect selection on EPC behavior in females. A comparison between the two types of selection suggests that the force of direct negative selection is generally much stronger than that of indirect positive selection. Indirect selection is thus unlikely to maintain EPC behavior in the face of direct selection against it. We suggest that EPCs may instead be the result of antagonistic selection on loci influencing the outcome of male-female encounters and that EPC behavior per se may not be adaptive for females but may reflect sexual conflict due to strong selection in males to achieve extrapair copulations.",generally negative direct selection on EPC behavior and indirect selection is unlikely to maintain EPC,,,,meta analysis using quantiative genetic approximations of selection,,EPCs may be the result of antagonistic selectin on loci and that EPC may not be adaptive,probably not,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

However, Hamilton's equation as he originally expressed it is simplistic. A genetically oriented approach to studying multilevel selection can provide insights into how the terminology and assumptions used by Hamilton can be generalized. Using contextual analysis I demonstrated that Hamilton's rule actually embodies three distinct processes, group selection, individual selection, and transmission genetics or heritability. Whether an altruistic trait will evolve depends the balance of all of these factors. The genetical approach, and particularly, contextual analysis provides a means of separating these factors and examining them one at a time. Perhaps the greatest issue with Hamilton's equation is the interpretation of r. Hamilton (1964a) interpreted this as relatedness. In this paper I show that what Hamilton called relatedness is more generally interpreted as the proportion for variance among groups, and that many processes in addition to relatedness can increase the variance among groups. I also show that the evolution of an altruistic trait is driven by the ratio of the heritability at the group level to the heritability at the individual level. Under some circumstances this ratio can be greater than 1. In this situation altruism can evolve even if selection favoring selfish behavior is stronger than selection favoring altruism.","re-evaluate Hamilton's altruism equations with a genetical approach, breaking it into group selection, individual selection, and heritability.

Herbivores can adapt by changing two adaptive traits: their level of specialization in feeding efficiency and their point of maximum feeding efficiency along the plant gradient. The number of herbivore phenotypes, their levels of specialization, and the amount of character displacement among them are the result of the evolutionary dynamics, which is driven by the underlying population dynamics, which in turn is driven by the underlying foraging behavior. Our analysis demonstrates broad conditions for the diversification of a herbivore population into many specialized phenotypes, for basically any foraging behavior focusing use on highest gains while also including errors. Our model predicts two characteristic phases in the adaptation of herbivore phenotypes: a fast character-displacement phase and a slow coevolutionary niche-shift phase. This two-phase pattern is expected to be of wide relevance in various consumer-resource systems. Bringing together ecological character displacement and the evolution of specialization in a single model, our study suggests that the foraging behavior of herbivorous arthropods is a key factor promoting specialist radiation.",evolutionary dynamics and ecological character displacement in one model,,,,model,,predicts two characteristic phases in the adaptation of herbivor phenotypes - not relevant for chapter,no,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

In relation to sexual selection, when an ornamental trait interacts with phenotypic quality to determine mating success, correlational sexual selection should generate genetic correlations between the ornament and quality, leading to the evolution of honest signals. Despite its potential importance in the evolution of signal honesty, correlational sexual selection has rarely been measured in natural populations. In the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), mates with experimentally elevated values of a plumage trait (whiteness in the tail or ""tail white"") are more attractive to females and dominant in aggressive encounters over resources. We used restricted maximum-likelihood analysis of a long-term dataset to measure the heritability of tail white and two components of body size (wing length and tail length), as well as genetic correlations between pairs of these traits. We then used multiple regression to assess directional, quadratic, and correlational selection as they acted on tail white and body size via four components of lifetime fitness (juvenile and adult survival, mating success, and fecundity). We found a positive genetic correlation between tail white and body size (as measured by wing length), which indicates past correlational selection. Correlational selection, which was largely due to sexual selection on males, was also found to be currently acting on the same pair of traits. Larger males with whiter tails sired young with more females, most likely due to a combination of female choice, which favors males with whiter tails, and male-male competition, which favors both tail white and larger body size. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show both genetic correlations between sexually selected traits and currently acting correlational sexual selection, and we suggest that correlational sexual selection frequently may be an important mechanism for maintaining the honesty of sexual signals.",heritability of tail white and body size which are more attractive to females and dominant in aggressive encounters. ,Junco hyemalis,dark-eyed junco,Aves,REML of long-term dataset,pedigree,"positive genetic correlation between tail white and body size indicating correlational selection, an dit had fitness consequences",later,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

This question is of central importance when evaluating the relationship between sexually antagonistic 'chase-away' scenarios and models of more traditional female choice. Currently, there is a mismatch between theories: indirect benefits are seen to play a role in conventional mate choice, whereas they are not predicted to have an influence on the outcome if matings impose direct costs on females. This is at odds with the idea that resistance and preference are two sides of the same coin: either leads to a subset of males enjoying enhanced mating success. In the same way as choosy females benefit from mating with sexy males if this yields sexy sons, females could benefit from being manipulated or 'seduced', if the manipulative or seductive ability of males is heritable. Here I build a model where male dominance (or coerciveness) improves his mating success, and this relationship can be modified by female behaviour. This clarifies the definitions of resistance and preference: resisting females diminish the benefit a male gains from being dominant, while preferences enhance this pre-existing benefit enjoyed by dominant males.

This LD-based mapping approach can be made more efficient when it is coupled with interval mapping characterizing the genetic distance between markers and QTL. This article describes a general statistical framework for simultaneously estimating the linkage and LD that are related in a two-stage hierarchical sampling scheme. This framework is constructed within a maximum likelihood context and can be expanded to fine-scale mapping of complex traits for different population structures and reproductive behaviors. We provide a closed-form solution for joint estimation of quantitative genetic parameters describing QTL effects, QTL position and residual variances, and population genetic parameters describing allele frequencies and QTL-marker LD. We perform simulation studies to investigate the statistical properties of our joint analysis model for interval and LD mapping.

 J, JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL & COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY," Ghosh, DCAF Ghosh, DC", A new scale of electronegativity based on absolute radii of atoms,4,2005," A new scale of electronegativity is designed on the basis of the environment independent absolute radii of atoms. In this scale, the electronegativity is an intrinsic free-atom property and the basis of assumption is quantum mechanically viable. The qualitative relation between the size and electronegativity is relied upon and a quantitative general formula of evaluation of electronegativity in terms of the absolute radii of atoms is suggested as chi = a x (1/R) + b, where chi is electronegativity and R is absolute radius of atoms, a and b are two constants determined by least square fitting for each period of elements separately. A number known as electronegativity is computed for each 103 elements of periodic table through the above formula and the unit assigned to chi is energy. The new scale of electronegativity is found to observe the simple rules that all the scales of electronegativity must obey. The evaluated scale reproduces the silicon rule where the electronegativities of the eight elements of metalloid group are very close to each other and the electronegativity of silicon atom is smallest of the group. A striking feature of the new scale is that the electronegativity of N atom is greater than that of Cl atom. The characteristic properties of chalcogens and transition metal atoms have been nicely correlated in terms of the computed values of chi of such elements. The evaluated electronegativities of the elements beautifully exhibit the periodic behaviour of periods and groups of the Periodic Table. The revealed internal consistencies suggest that the present effort of introducing a scale of electronegativity based on absolute radius of atoms is largely successful.",not relevant,,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Lava lizards (Microlophus albemarlensis) on the small island of Plaza Sur in the Galapagos archipelago inhabit contrasting habitats: dense vegetation on the western end of the island thins rapidly in a transitional area, before becoming absent on the eastern half. Associated with these habitats are phenotypic differences in traits linked to predator avoidance (increased wariness, sprint speed, and endurance in lizards from the sparsely vegetated habitat). This population provides an opportunity to test the hypothesis that reduced gene flow is necessary for phenotypic differentiation. There was no evidence of any differences among habitats in allele frequencies at six out of seven microsatellite loci examined, nor was there any indication of congruence between patterns of genetic variability and the change in vegetation regime. We infer that gene flow between the habitats on Plaza Sur must be sufficiently high to overcome genetic drift within habitats but that it does not preclude phenotypic differentiation.",looking at gene flow and drift in two diverging populations - not quantitative genetics,Microlophus albemarlensis,lava lizards,Reptilia,microsatellites to estimate population differentiation,,not quantitative genetics,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

One major change in the emergence of this discipline was an explicit new focus on viewing organisms as the evolutionary products of natural selection. The shift in research emphasis from comparative physiology to evolutionary physiology has resulted in physiological traits becoming important elements in broad research programs of evolution and ecology. Evolutionary quantitative genetics is a theory-based biological discipline that has developed the quantitative tools to test explicit evolutionary hypotheses. The role of quantitative genetics has been paramount, in studying the microevolution of morphology, behavior and life history, but not comparative physiology. As a consequence, little basic information is known such as additive genetic variation of physiological traits and the magnitude of genetically based trade-offs (i.e., genetic correlations) with other traits.

 J, BEHAVIOR GENETICS," Kolliker, MAF Kolliker, M", Ontogeny in the family,35,2005," When ontogeny takes place in a family, and parents provide essential resources for development, the parents become an environmental component to the development of a wide range of offspring traits. Because differences among parents may partly reflect genetic variation, this environmental component contains genes and may itself evolve. Also, when offspring play an active role in family interactions, offspring become a social environmental component to parents, affecting their behavior in turn, which potentially results in reciprocal social selection. Thus, an evolutionary process of coadaptation to family life, additionally driven by conflicts of interests, may have shaped the expression and development patterns underlying infant behaviors. The complex genetics arising from family interactions can be formalized by extending standard quantitative genetic models. These models demonstrate how the explicit consideration of the family environment can profoundly alter both the expression and evolutionary response to selection of behaviors involved in family interactions. Behavioral genetic studies have begun to unravel the complex genetics underlying infant solicitation behaviors and parental provisioning, although many focus on one side of the interaction. A genetic analysis incorporating interactions among family members explicitly may be critical because the genes underlying the expression of parental provisioning indirectly affect offspring behaviors, and vice versa.",complex genetics arising from family interactions can be formalized by extending standard quantiatiave genetic models,,,,review,,flexibility of quantiative genetics approach - and considering family environment can profoundly alter both expression and evolutionary repsonse to selection of behaviors,probably not,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,not human
 J," CURRENT TOPICS IN DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY, VOL 66"," Meffert, LM   Hagenbuch, KLAF Meffert, LM   Hagenbuch, KL", The genetic architecture of house fly mating behavior,66,2005," This chapter summarizes several experimental approaches used to identify the effects of dominance, epistasis, and genotype-by-environment interactions in the genetic architecture of the mating behavior of the common house fly (Musca domestica L.). Quantitative genetic investigations of mating behavior hold special intrigue for unraveling the complexities of fitness traits, with applications to theory on sexual selection and speciation. Besides being well suited to large-scale quantitative genetic protocols, the house fly has a remarkably complex courtship repertoire, affording special opportunities for studies on communication, social interactions, and learning. Increased additive genetic variances for the courtship repertoire of experimentally bottlenecked populations provided evidence for the presence of dominance and/or epistasis. Negative genetic variances in these populations suggested genotype-by-environment interactions, where the environment is the mating partner. Line cross assays of populations that had been subjected to selection for divergent courtship repertoire confirmed that both dominance and epistasis have significant effects. These crosses also showed more directly that the expression of the male's genotype is dependent upon the preferences of his mating partner. Repeatability studies also detailed how males alter their courtship performances with successive encounters within and across females, such that the males learn to improve their techniques in securing copulations. A review of 41 animal behavior studies found that a wide range of traits and taxa have dominance, epistasis, and genotype-y-environment interactions, although house fly courtship may remain a unique model where learning is an intersexually selected trait. Future development of more sophisticated molecular techniques for the M. domestica genome will help unravel the underlying biochemical and developmental pathways of these quantitative genetic interactions for a more complete understanding of the processes of inbreeding depression, outbreeding depression, and pleiotropy.

It is based on examination of the distribution of parental strains and the F-1 and F-2 hybrids in a multidimensional space, and the determination of the directions corresponding to heterozygosity, epistatic and additive gene effects. The effect of heterozygosity includes variability produced by interaction between and within heterozygous loci. The additive gene effects and the remaining epistatic interactions between the homozygous loci can be visualized separately from the effects of heterozygosity by an appropriate projection of the points in multidimensional space. In all, 20 morphological, physiological and behavioural characters and 21 craniometric measures were studied in crosses between two laboratory rat strains. Linear combinations of craniometric and of morphophysiological characters with a high narrow-sense heritability could be identified.

Two-way artificial selections for the duration of death-feigning, over 10 generations, showed a clear direct response in the trait and a correlated response in the frequency of death-feigning, thus indicating variation and inheritance of death-feigning behaviour. A comparison of the two selected strains with divergent frequencies of death-feigning showed a significant difference in the fitness for survival when a model predator, a female Adanson jumper spider, Hasarius adansoni Audouin (Araneomophae: Salticidae), was presented to the beetles.

Both twin (correlated gamma-frailty) and non-twin models (univariate gamma-frailty) were utilized and compared regarding their suitability for genetic analyses. The study population consisted of twins born in Sweden between 1886 and 1925. As expected, our findings indicate that genetic influences are important for CHD-death. Inclusion of risk factors in the twin-model increased heritability estimates, primarily due to a substantial reduction in non-shared environmental variances. The genetic influences for CHD-death are only marginally mediated through the risk factors among males, but more so among females.

We also found that daughters differed in their choosiness during mate-choice experiments depending on whether they originated from eggs produced early or late within the laying sequence of a clutch. Because this effect of laying order occurred independently of hatching order in cross-fostered broods, it must have been caused by consistent within-mother variation in maternal effects transmitted through the egg.

Although there has been considerable recent progress towards understanding the environmental factors and genetic pathways that regulate lifespan, little is known about the genes causing naturally occurring variation in longevity. Previously, we used deficiency complementation mapping to map two closely linked quantitative trait loci (QTL) causing female-specific variation in longevity between the Oregon (Ore) and 2b strains of Drosophila melanogaster to 35B9-C3 and 35C3 on the second chromosome. The 35B9-C3 QTL encompasses a 50-kb region including four genes, for one of which, shuttle craft (stc), mutations have been generated. The 35C3 QTL localizes to a 200-kb interval with 15 genes, including three genes for which mutations exist (reduced (rd), guftagu (gft) and ms(2)35Ci). Here, we report quantitative complementation tests to mutations at these four positional candidate genes, and show that ms(2)35Ci and stc are novel candidate quantitative trait genes affecting variation in Drosophila longevity. Complementation tests with stc alleles reveal sex- and allele-specific failure to complement, and complementation effects are dependent on the genetic background, indicating considerable epistasis for lifespan. in addition, a homozygous viable stc allele has a sex-specific effect on lifespan. stc encodes an RNA polymerase II transcription factor, and is an attractive candidate gene for the regulation of longevity and variation in longevity, because it is required for motoneuron development and is expressed throughout development.

So far, these assessments can only be performed at the population level. Therefore, they determine the average gene expression within a population, overlooking possible cell-to-cell heterogeneity that Could lead to different cell behaviors/cell fates. Understanding individual cell behavior requires multiple gene expression analyses of single cells, and may be fundamental for the understanding of all types of biological events and/or differentiation processes. We here describe a new reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach allowing the simultaneous quantification of the expression of 20 genes in the same single cell. This method has broad application, in different species and any type of gene combination. RT efficiency is evaluated. Uniform and maximized amplification conditions for all genes are provided. Abundance relationships are maintained, allowing the precise quantification of the absolute number of mRNA molecules per cell, ranging from 2 to 1.28x10(9) for each individual gene. We evaluated the impact of this approach on functional genetic read-outs by studying ail apparently homogeneous population (monoclonal T cells recovered 4 d after antigen stimulation), using either this method or conventional real-time RT-PCR. Single-cell studies revealed considerable cell-to-cell variation: All T cells did not express all individual genes. Gene coexpression patterns were very heterogeneous. mRNA copy numbers varied between different transcripts and in different cells. As a consequence, this single-cell assay introduces new and fundamental information regarding functional genomic read-outs. By comparison, we also show that conventional quantitative assays determining population averages supply insufficient information, and may even be highly misleading.",not relevant,,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Experimentally naive rats, when exposed to mild stress of a novel environment, exhibit variability in their exploratory activity. Some rats display high rates of locomotor reactivity to novelty (high responders (HR)), and others display low rates (low responders (LR)). The LRHR phenotype is a reliable predictor of drug-taking behaviour and is linked to differences in hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression. In this study, we investigated whether the LRHR phenotype is associated with differences in the quantitative morphology of the hippocampal field CA3, dentate gyrus molecular layer, granule cell layer and mossy fibres. LRs and HRs showed no significant differences in the Volumes of CA3 and dentate molecular layer volume or the number of dentate granule cells. However, LRs had a significantly larger suprapyramidal mossy fibre terminal field volume when compared to HRs. The infrapyramidal mossy fibres did not differ between phenotypes. Also, we found a LRHR phenotype-independent significant negative correlation between molecular layer volume per granule cell and the total number of granule cells.

Parental provisioning had positive effects on offspring performance and fitness, while remaining near the larvae without feeding them had negative effects. Begging had positive effects on offspring performance and fitness, while increased competition among siblings had negative effects. Coadaptations between parenting and offspring behavior appear to be maintained by genetic correlations and functional trade-offs; parents that feed their offspring more also spend more time in the area where they can forage for themselves.

 J, JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY," Henter, HJAF Henter, HJ", Constrained sex allocation in a parasitoid due to variation in male   quality,17,2004," The theory of constrained sex allocation posits that when a fraction of females in a haplodiploid population go unmated and thus produce only male offspring, mated females will evolve to lay a female-biased sex ratio. I examined evidence for constrained sex ratio evolution in the parasitic hymenopteran Uscana semifumipennis. Mated females in the laboratory produced more female-biased sex ratios than the sex ratio of adults hatching from field-collected eggs, consistent with constrained sex allocation theory. However, the male with whom a female mated affected her offspring sex ratio, even when sperm was successfully transferred, suggesting that constrained sex ratios can occur even in populations where all females succeed in mating. A positive relationship between sex ratio and fecundity indicates that females may become sperm-limited. Variation among males occurred even at low fecundity, however, suggesting that other factors may also be involved. Further, a quantitative genetic experiment found significant additive genetic variance in the population for the sex ratio of offspring produced by females. This has only rarely been demonstrated in a natural population of parasitoids, but is a necessary condition for sex ratio evolution. Finally, matings with larger males produced more female-biased offspring sex-ratios, suggesting positive selection on male size. Because the great majority of parasitic hymenoptera are monandrous, the finding of natural variation among males in their capacity to fertilize offspring, even after mating successfully, suggests that females may often be constrained in the sex allocation by inadequate number or quality of sperm transferred.",additive genetic variance for sex ratio of offspring produced - not behavior,Uscana semifumipennis,parasitic hymenopteran,Insecta,investigated sex ratios in the lab plus quantitative genetic experiment,,not behavior,no,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

We first show that the optimal angles for jumping maximum horizontal distances range from 39degrees to 42degrees, but the average jump angle of the 12 species is about 36degrees. Interestingly, these ""suboptimal"" jumping angles result in only a small decrement in jump distance but substantial savings in flight duration and jump height. Further, our data show that the two key variables associated with increased jumping velocity (hindlimb length and takeoff acceleration) are independent of one another. Thus, there are two possible ways to achieve superior jumping capabilities: to evolve more muscular limbs-as stronger legs will produce more force and, hence, more acceleration-or evolve longer limbs. Our data show that anole species face trade-offs that prevent them from simultaneously optimizing different aspects of jumping ability but that they appear to have evolved behaviors that partially overcome these trade-offs.",not quantitative genetics,Anolis,Caribbean Anolis lizards,Reptilia,jumping biomechanics,,investigated 12 species biomechanics and find two possible ways to achieve superiro jumping capabilities: evolve more muscular limbs or longer limbs,no,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,not human

The maternal-offspring interactions play a pivotal role in shaping the direction and rate of evolution in terms of their substantial contribution to quantitative genetic (co)variation. To study the genetics and evolution of maternal-offspring interactions, a unifying statistical framework that embraces both the direct and indirect genetic effects of maternal and offspring QTL on any complex trait is developed. This model is derived for a simple backcross design within the maximum-likelihood context, implemented with the EM algorithm. Results front extensive simulations suggest that this model can provide reasonable estimation of additive and dominant effects of the QTL at different generations and their interaction effects derived from the maternal and offspring genomes. Although our model is trained to characterize the actions and interactions of maternal and offspring QTL affecting offspring traits, the idea can be readily extended to decipher the genetic machinery of maternal traits, Such as maternal care.

Plant lines tested included the commercial 'Shady Lady', 'Yellow Pear', '7718 VFN', 'QualiT 21', and the plant introduction line PI 134417. Insecticides included a kaolin particle film, pymetrozine, pyriproxyfen, spinosad, and imidacloprid. Psyllids spent significantly more time feeding on 'Yellow Pear' than all other plant lines except '7718 VFN'. In comparisons among plant lines, psyllids exposed to the wild accession PI 134417 showed a 98% reduction in feeding, a significant increase in jumping behavior, and a significant tendency to abandon the leaves, thereby demonstrating repellency, not just an antixenosis response. Interactions between plant lines and insecticides influenced behavioral responses. All insecticides tested significantly reduced feeding durations on all cultivars except the preferred 'Yellow Pear'. However, nonfeeding activities such as walking, probing, resting, and jumping varied substantially with chemical and cultivar combination.

We investigated the effects of food on sex-specific growth in the cellar spider Pholcus phalangioides, a sexually dimorphic spider with larger males than females. In a full sib design, 1164 offspring of 39 once-mated females were reared to sexual maturity under two feeding regimes. Food level had strong positive effects on (1) offspring body size, with males growing larger than females, and (2) offspring mass, with females maturing heavier than males; it had negative effects on (3) development time for males but not females. Males matured before females under unlimited food conditions. Analysing the entire ontogeny revealed that until the last instar, both sexes were equally retarded in development by food limitation, males lagging behind females. During the last instar, the picture reversed: development time of males was equally long at high and low food. while females had extremely long development at high food and abbreviated development at low food. We conclude that females are selected to increase mass and hence fecundity, while sexual selection apparently favours larger males but at the same time earlier maturity (i.e. protandry). Achieving both was only possible when food was plentiful, and is facilitated by a low genetic correlation between development time and body size. We found high genetic variation, as well as genotype-environment interactions, for size, mass, development time and growth rate, and consequently high full-sib but lower parent-offspring (size only) heritabilities.

Results: The results were consistent with the existence of a singular, continuously distributed underlying factor, resulting in disparate phenotypic manifestations across the three criterion domains for autistic disorder (social deficits, language deficits, and repetitive/ stereotypic behaviors). Conclusion: The analyses generally failed to support the existence of independent sub domains of dysfunction in autism spectrum conditions.

Offspring sensitivity to maternal conditions is believed to have evolved to favor preadaptation of offspring to environmental factors they are likely to encounter. Because the locomotor capacity of an individual is likely to have important fitness consequences, we examined the role of long-term and short-term prenatal conditions on offspring's locomotor performance in the lizard Lacerta vivipara. To examine long-term prenatal effects, we manipulated the density of two populations, leaving two additional populations as unmanipulated. We then collected pregnant females within these four populations (Cevennes, Massif Central, France) and kept them in the laboratory until parturition. To examine short-term prenatal effects, we manipulated the corticosterone level of half the females within each population. We took two different measurements of offspring locomotion: sprint speed and endurance. As already documented, sprint speed was positively correlated with offspring body size. Although population density significantly affected female fecundity, neither the density manipulation nor the population of origin influenced offspring phenotype. Corticosterone administered during gestation decreased juvenile sprint speed but did not affect juvenile endurance. Furthermore, we observed that the motivation to run was influenced by maternal hormonal treatment. Juveniles born from corticosterone-treated mothers needed more stimuli than those born from control mothers. We conclude, therefore, that the action of corticosterone on sprint speed could be more behavioral than physiological.

This leaves unaddressed the question of whether such coexistence can also be expected on an evolutionary timescale. In this article, we study the attainability, through gradual evolution, of specialist-generalist coexistence, as well as the evolutionary stability of such communities when allowing for immigration. Our analysis shows that the potential for specialist-generalist coexistence is much more restricted than originally thought and strongly depends on the trade-off structure assumed. We establish that ecological coexistence is less likely for species facing a trade-off between per capita reproduction in different habitats than when the trade-off acts on carrying capacities alone. We also demonstrate that coexistence is evolutionarily stable whenever it is ecologically stable but that in most cases, such coexistence cannot be reached through gradual evolution. We conclude that an evolutionarily stable community of specialists and generalists may be created only through immigration from elsewhere or through mutations of large effect.

Starvation resistance is a quantitative trait controlled by multiple interacting genes and exhibits considerable genetic variation in natural populations. This genetic variation could be maintained in the fact of strong selection clue to a trade-off in resource allocation between reproductive activity and individual survival. Knowledge of the genes affecting starvation tolerance and the subset of genes that affect variation in starvation resistance in natural populations would enable its to evaluate this hypothesis from a quantitative genetic perspective. We screened 933 co-isogenic P-element insertion lines to identify candidate genes affecting starvation tolerance. A total of 383 P-element insertions induced highly significant and often sex-specific mutational variance in starvation resistance. We also used deficiency complementation mapping followed by complementation to mutations to identify 12 genes contributing to variation in starvation resistance between two wild-type strains. The genes we identified are involved in oogenesis, metabolism, and feeding behaviors, indicating a possible link to reproduction and survival. However, we also found genes with cell fate specification and cell proliferation phenotypes, which implies that resource allocation during development and at the cellular level may also influence the phenotypic response to starvation.",identify candidate genes affecting starvation tolerance - not behavior,Drosophila melanogaster,fruit fly,Insecta,coisogenic insertion lines,inbred lines,identify specific genes related to starvation resistance - not behavior,no,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Previous studies show that males attempt to mount females without courtship, females use vigorous shaking behaviour in response to male mounting, the duration of shaking is an indicator of both direct and indirect female choice and sexual conflict, and larger males enjoy a mating advantage. We conducted a quantitative genetic paternal half sib study to investigate the genetic underpinnings of these traits, notably body size (the preferred trait) and the associated female preference, and to assess the relative importance of various models generally proposed to account for the evolution of sexually selected traits. Several morphological traits and female shaking duration were heritable, thus meeting a key requirement of all sexual selection models. In contrast, two traits indicative of male persistence in mating were not. Male longevity was also heritable and negatively correlated with his mating effort, suggesting a mating cost. However, the crucial genetic correlation between male body size and female shaking duration. predicted to be negative by both 'good genes' and Fisherian models and positive by the sexual conflict (or chase-away) model, was zero. This could be because of low power, or because of constraints imposed by the genetic correlation structure.

Here, we investigated whether male ability to win contests is correlated with aerobic capacity (the maximum rate of oxygen consumption) or factorial aerobic scope (the ratio of aerobic capacity to basal metabolic rate [BMR]). The ability to win was assessed as proportion of dominant behaviours in staged contests with five other males, and aerobic capacity was measured both during exercise (swimming) and during cold-exposure trials. Contest winning ability was not correlated with the aerobic capacity (p > 0.6), the factorial metabolic scope (p > 0.25) or BMR (p = 0.24; all the traits were corrected for the effect of body mass).

The existence of such link is still controversial, but studies with anuran amphibians support a correlation between (V) over dotO(2 rest) and (V) over dotO(2 act) at both the intraspecific and interspecific levels. Because results at the intraspecific level are based only on a few species, we test for the generality of a link between these two metabolic variables in anurans by studying the intraspecific correlational patterns between mass-independent (V) over dotO(2 rest) and (V) over dotO(2 act) in anurans.

R.", Sifaka positional behavior: Ontogenetic and quantitative genetic   approaches.,,2004,"In many primate species, hands and feet are large relative to neonatal body weight, and they subsequently exhibit negative allometric growth during ontogeny. Here, data are presented showing that this pattern holds for a wild population of lemur, Verreaux’s sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi verreauxi). Using morphometric data collected on this population, it is shown that younger animals possess relatively large hands and feet. This ontogenetic pattern suggests a simple behavioral test: do juvenile animals with their larger, almost adultsized hands and feet locomote on similarly sized substrates as adult animals? Using locomotor bout sampling, this question was tested by collecting positional behavior data on this population. Results from this test find no differences in locomotor behaviors or substrate use between yearlings and adult animals. To place these results in a broader evolutionary context, heritabilities and selection gradients of hands, feet, and other limb elements for animals in this population were estimated. Among limb elements, heritabilities range from 0.16– 0.44, with the foot having the lowest value. Positive directional selection acts most strongly on the foot (directional selection gradient ¼ 0.119). The low heritability and positive selection coefficient indicate that selection has acted, and continues to act, on foot size in young animals. These results are interpreted within a functional context with respect to the development of locomotor coordination: larger feet enable young animals to use ‘‘adult-sized’’ substrates when they move through their habitat. It is suggested that the widespread pattern of negative allometry of the extremities in sifaka and other primates is maintained by selection, and does not simply reflect a primitive developmental pathway that has no adaptive basis.

The evolutionary concepts of altruism, kin selection, and sexual selection have dominated interpretations of social behavior and interindividual interactions. However, at times there has been confusion among researchers about the meaning of terms used in evolutionary theory and a consequent lack of empirical work measuring the crucial theoretical parameters. Here, I will first review the concepts of quantitative evolutionary theory (Falconer and Mackay 1996; Lynch and Walsh 1998), their application to situations in which social interactions play an important role in determining variation in individual characteristics (Wolf et al. 1998), and, briefly, empirical studies on cooperative breeding that have successfully measured the parameters specified in evolutionary theory.",review quantitative genetics and how they apply to social interactions and then empirical examples on cooperative breeding,,,,review,,"important to consider suites of traits in a multivariate framework, otherwise you could infer that one trait is under direct selection when it's actually under correlated selection (Lande and Arnold 1983).

Fisher derived variance in breeding values over loci - and showed that it's the same as function of covariance between offspring and parents. ""Heritable covariances can have a major effect on evolutionary processes, limiting evolutionary response to selection and causing substantial deviations from the optimal, adaptive evolutionary path (Cheverud 1984)"" Social contexts: environment provided by conspecifics influences development, obviously seen in developmental environment provided by mammalian mothers. Consider heritable covariance of direct genetic effects and indirect genetic effects. Altruism: to be considered altruistic, it must entail a cost of performing the behavior and a benefit for the recipient, but it's a statement about relativ selection gradients and not individual behavior. Hamilton did not allow direct genetic effects of genes carried out by the recipient on its own phenotype. Cheverud (1984) redefined this rule to include indirect genetic effects. Long-term studies have shown that helping behavior in cooperative breeders does not entail fitness costs (Clutton-Brock 2002) - therefore it's not altruistic, and is therefore not kin selection.

Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous syndrome both at the etiological and clinical levels. In particular, patients with schizophrenia exhibit important variability in their therapeutic and metabolic responses to clozapine, an antipsychotic medication. Objective. Here, we determine whether two mouse strains show differing clozapine responses with respect to weight gain, enhancement of prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle, and reversal of amphetamine-induced locomotion. Observed between-strain differences may be partly due to genetic factors that can be subsequently mapped using quantitative genetic approaches. Methods. We treated the A/J and C57BL/6J inbred mouse strains with clozapine for 22 days. Prepulse inhibition and amphetamine-induced locomotion were measured after 3-4 days of clozapine treatment and again after 21-22 days of treatment. Weight gain was also monitored during treatment. Results. Three-day treatment with clozapine increased prepulse inhibition in both strains. Four-day clozapine treatment reduced amphetamine-induced locomotion only in the C57BL/6J strain. Long-term (21-22 days) clozapine treatment did not affect these behaviors in either strain. After an initial weight loss during the first 5 days, clozapine (4 mg/kg) induced a significant weight gain in both strains. Conclusions. The reversal of schizophrenia-related behaviors after short-term, but not long-term, clozapine treatment is consistent with other rodent studies. Although short-term clozapine treatment reduced amphetamine-induced locomotion only in the C57BL/6J strain, strain differences in amphetamine responses confound the interpretation of these results; therefore, quantitative genetic approaches may be difficult to carry out with this trait.

A rapid recovery was observed a few days after parturition for endurance, while sprint speed recovered more slowly.   3. A physical impairment due to body mass was detected for endurance capacity, but not for sprint speed.

A particularly important distinction is the extent to which qualitative aspects of network performance are encoded in network topology as opposed to being determined through quantitative details, such as those of kinetics. Here, we develop a general and rigorous mathematical framework for the analysis of genetic networks and apply it to a family of synthetic gene networks. A key feature of our methodology involves determining network behavior that is insensitive to kinetic parameters Such as rate constants and nonlinear functional dependencies of rates oil molecular concentrations.

Previous optimization theory indicated that mating system interacts with life-history traits to influence the age at first reproduction, providing three testable predictions. First, isolated individuals should reproduce later than individuals with available mates in the expectancy of finding a partner and avoiding the cost of inbreeding. Second, resource reallocation to future fecundity is needed for such reproductive delays to evolve. Third, the reproductive delay can be optimized with respect to life-history traits ( e. g., survival, growth) and the mating system ( inbreeding depression). Our results largely validate these predictions. First, reproduction is significantly delayed in isolated individuals (""selfers"") as compared with individuals frequently exposed to mates (""outcrossers""). Second, delayed reproduction is associated with reallocation to future growth, survival, and fecundity, although fecundity is also affected by the mating system (selfing vs. outcrossing). Third, the reproductive delay found ( approximately 2 wk) is consistent with quantitative predictions from optimization models. The delay is largely heritable, which might be partly explained by among-family differences in the amount of inbreeding depression ( mating system) but not growth or survival.","mating behavior includes mating delay,which is heritable - compared selfers and outcrossers",Physa acuta,snail,Gastropoda,compared selfers and outcrossers in terms of mting behavior,other,unclear if this will be useful,maybe,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

These theoretical underpinnings are translated into mathematical equations that allow the assessment of the contribution of observed (using DNA samples) and unobserved (using known genetic relationships) genetic variation to population variance in quantitative traits. Several statistical models for quantitative genetic analyses are described, such as models for the classical twin design, multivariate and longitudinal genetic analyses, extended twin analyses, and linkage and association analyses. For each, we show how the theoretical biometrical model can be translated into algebraic equations that may be used to generate scripts for statistical genetic software packages, such as Mx, Lisrel, SOLAR, or MERLIN.

Thus, morphological variation is believed to have fitness consequences through affecting locomotor performance. This paper firstly evaluates the dependence of burst speed on morphology, and secondly examines the movement patterns of free-ranging undisturbed wall lizards (Podarcis muralis) engaged in several kinds of activity. Body size was the most important correlate of burst speed as performed at the optimal temperature for running in the laboratory. After removing size effects from performance and morphological traits, the length of some particular limb segments had positive influence on burst speed, but these effects were weak, each trait explaining less than 16% of variance in burst speed. Free-ranging R muralis exhibited intermittent locomotion, with movement sequences interrupted by frequent short pauses. Field movement patterns greatly differed depending upon the kind of activity and were in most aspects independent of the size and sex of the animal. R muralis involved in thermoregulation performed short and low-speed displacements; exploratory activities were characterized by frequent, slow and short movements. On the contrary, lizards involved in intraspecific pursuits and predator escape developed comparatively high speeds, although only exceptionally did they attain the size-specific burst speed predicted from the laboratory trials. Speed of escape increased with distance to the refuge and the animals are able to assess predation risks to modulate approach distance, speed and pauses, so maximum exertion is seldom required. The evolution of locomotor capacities exceeding routine needs is discussed in the context of the principle of excessive construction.

 J, GENETICS," Waxman, D   Peck, JRAF Waxman, D   Peck, JR", The anomalous effects of biased mutation,164,2003," A model is presented in which alleles at a number of loci combine to influence the value of a quantitative trait that is subject to stabilizing selection. Mutations can occur to alleles at the loci under consideration. Some of these mutations will tend to increase the value of the trait, while others will tend to decrease it. In contrast to most previous models, we allow the mean effect of mutations to be nonzero. This means that, on average, mutations can have a bias, such that they tend to either increase or decrease the value of the trait. We find, unsurprisingly, that biased mutation moves the equilibrium mean value of the quantitative trait in the direction of the bias. What is more surprising is the behavior of the deviation of the equilibrium mean value of the trait from its optimal value. This has it nonmonotonic dependance oil the degree of bias, so that increasing the degree of bias can actually bring the mean phenotype closer to the optimal phenotype. Furthermore, there is a definite maximum to the extent to which biased mutation can cause a difference between the mean phenotype and the optimum. For plausible parameter values, this maximum-possible difference is small. Typically, quantitative-genetics models assume an unconstrained model of mutation, where the expected difference in effect between a parental allele and a mutant allele is independent of the current state of the parental allele. Our results show that models of this sort can easily lead to biologically implausible consequences when mutations are biased. In particular, unconstrained mutation typically leads to a continual increase or decrease in the mean allelic effects at all trait-controlling loci. Thus at each of these loci, the mean allelic effect. eventually becomes extreme. This suggests that some of the models of mutations frost commonly used in quantitative genetics should he modified so as to introduce genetic constraints.",increasing degree of bias can actually bring the mean phenotype closer to the optimum - not really behavior,,,,theoretical model,,not really relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, HUMAN BIOLOGY," Vitzthum, VJAF Vitzthum, VJ", A number no greater than the sum of its parts: The use and abuse of   heritability,75,2003," Though widely used in quantitative genetics, in the study of human variation perhaps no statistic is more easily misinterpreted than heritability. While the contribution of genetic heritage to complex biological and behavioral phenotypes cannot be lightly dismissed, nonetheless we remain profoundly ignorant of how that legacy plays out in any environmental context. To be sure, it is not reducible to a single number. Nor does the preference among anthropologists for analyzing biological rather than behavioral phenotypes improve what heritability can reasonably say about the sources of human variation. This paper discusses the meaning of heritability, the methods for its estimation, the fallacies underlying its misuse, and its utility for inquiries in evolutionary anthropology and epidemiology. Progress in anthropological genetics will be realized through greater sophistication in study designs, including the measurement of environmental (physical and sociocultural) variation and the judicious choice of phenotypes for study. Elucidating the ontogenetic processes underlying adaptive plasticity is particularly critical to understanding the evolution of human biological variation. Such advancements will also shed light on the feasibility of genotype-targeted biomedical treatments. Failure to appreciate the limits of such approaches can divert resources from demonstrably effective environmentally based health interventions that benefit entire populations. Simplistic notions of genetic determinism should be challenged for the sake of our theories and the well-being of larger communities. As exemplified by the work of Frank B.

We investigated the influence of common lineage (family effect) and postnatal environmental conditions on latency to initiate preballooning tiptoe behaviour (ballooning latency) in the dwarfspider Erigone atra (Blackwall, 1841). The ballooning latency of individual spiders was tested in a specially designed test chamber. In a 3-week experiment, in which the spiders were fed only during the first day of each week, ballooning latency had low repeatability at weekly intervals. Ballooning latency declined with increasing food deprivation during the first week but not during the second and the third weeks. At intervals of less than I h, however, ballooning latency showed high repeatability. We also investigated whether maternal and postnatal environmental conditions (i.e. during juvenile development) influence phenotypic variation in ballooning latency. We reared offspring of several families under two feeding and two temperature conditions. Environmental conditions explained more variation in ballooning latency than family. Ballooning latency was lower in spiders reared at 20degreesC than in those reared at 15degreesC. In addition, spiderlings fed four prey per 3 days were faster ballooners than those fed only four prey per week. An interaction between factors was present, indicating the existence of different reaction norms between the two environmental conditions. The expression of ballooning latency behaviour thus strongly depends on current nutrition, feeding history and the feeding and temperature conditions during juvenile development.

This theory predicts that selection will shift the trade-off function itself and not just move the mean trait values along a fixed trade-off line, as is generally assumed in optimality models. As a consequence, quantitative genetic theory predicts that the trade-off function will vary among populations in which at least one of the component traits itself varies. This prediction is tested using the trade-off between call duration and flight capability, as indexed by the mass of the dorsolateral flight muscles, in the macropterous morph of the sand cricket. We use four different populations of crickets that vary in the proportion of macropterous males (Lab = 33%, Florida = 29%, Bermuda = 72%, South Carolina = 80%). We find, as predicted, that there is significant variation in the intercept of the trade-off function but not the slope, supporting the hypothesis that trade-off functions are better represented as bivariate normal distributions rather than single lines. We also test the prediction from a quantitative genetical model of the evolution of wing dimorphism that the mean call duration of macropterous males will increase with the percentage of macropterous males in the population. This prediction is also supported. Finally, we estimate the probability of a macropterous male attracting a female, P, as a function of the relative time spent calling (P = time spent calling by macropterous male/(total time spent calling by both micropterous and macropterous male). We find that in the Lab and Florida populations the probability of a female selecting the macropterous male is equal to P, indicating that preference is due simply to relative call duration. But in the Bermuda and South Carolina populations the probability of a female selecting a macropterous male is less than P, indicating a preference for the micropterous male even after differences in call duration are accounted for.",test tradeoff between call duration and flight capability in four pops of crickets and find significant variation in the intercept of the tradeoff but not the slope.

 J, OECOLOGIA," Haukioja, EAF Haukioja, E", Putting the insect into the birch-insect interaction,136,2003," Leaf maturation in mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) is characterized by rapid shifts in the types of dominant phenolics: from carbon-economic flavonoids aglycons in flushing leaves, via hydrolysable tannins and flavonoid glycosides, to carbon-rich proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) in mature foliage. This shift accords with the suggested trade-offs between carbon allocation to plant defense and growth, but may also relate to the simultaneous decline in nutritive leaf traits, such as water, proteins and sugars, which potentially limit insect growth. To elucidate how birch leaf quality translates into insect growth, I introduce a simple model that takes into account defensive compounds but also acknowledges insect demand for nutritive compounds. The effects of defensive compounds on insect growth depend strongly on background variation in nutritive leaf traits: compensatory feeding on low nutritive diets increases the intake of defensive compounds, and the availability of growth-limiting nutritive compounds may modify the effects of defenses. The ratio of consumption to larval growth (both in dry mass) increases very rapidly with leaf maturation: from 2.9 to 9.8 over 2 weeks in June-July, and to 15 by August. High concentrations in mature birch leaves of 'quantitative' defenses, such as proanthocyanidins (15-20% of dry mass), presumably prevent further consumption. If the same compounds had also protected half-grown leaves (which supported the same larval growth with only one third of the dry matter consumption of older leaves), the same intake of proanthocyanidins would have demanded improbably high concentrations (close to 50%) in young leaves. The model thus suggests an adaptive explanation for the high levels of 'quantitative' defenses, such as proanthocyanidins, in low-nutritive but not in high-nutritive leaves because of the behavioral responses of insect feeding to leaf nutritive levels.",not behavior,mountain birch,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

How adaptive changes in performance evolve therefore requires an understanding of how selection acts on multiple integrated traits. Two approaches that lend themselves to studying the evolution of performance in natural populations are the use of quantitative genetics models for estimating the strength of selection acting on multiple quantitative traits and ecological genetic comparisons of populations exhibiting phenotypic differences correlated with environmental variation. In both cases, the ultimate goal is to understand how suites of traits and trade-offs between competing functions respond to natural selection. Here we consider how these two complimentary approaches can be applied to study the adaptive evolution of escape performance in fish. We first present an extension of Arnold's (1983) quantitative genetic approach that explicitly considers how trade-offs between different components of performance interact with the underlying genetics. We propose that such a model can reveal the conditions under which multiple selection pressures will cause adaptive change in traits that influence more than one component of fitness. We then review work on the Atlantic silversides and Trinidadian guppies as two case studies where an ecological genetics approach has been successfully applied to evaluate how the evolution of escape performance trades-off with other components of fitness. We conclude with the general lesson that whole organism performance is embedded in a complex phenotype, and that the net outcome of selection acting on different aspects of the organism will often result in a compromise among competing influences.",consider extension of Arnold's (1983) quantitative genetic approach that considers trade offs between different components of performance,Atlantic sliversides and Trinidadian guppies,fish,Actinopterygii,review,,whole organism performance is embedded in a complex phenotype and that there will often be compromises among competing influences.

We then develop a quantitative genetic model based on these empirical findings to demonstrate that sympatric speciation indeed can occur under this mating regime in response to weak disruptive selection on body size. We also evaluate phylogenetic evidence bearing on sympatric speciation by asking whether tiny seahorse species are sister taxa to large sympatric relatives. Overall, our results indicate that sympatric speciation is a plausible mechanism for the diversification of seahorses, and that assortative mating (in this case as a result of male parental care) may warrant broader attention in the speciation process for some other taxonomic groups as well.",example of other approaches to understanding evolution of behaviors that include quantitative genetics,Syngnathidae,syngnathids,Actinopterygii,quantitative genetic model based on size assortative mating plus phylogenetic evidence,other,sympatric speciation as a result of male pregnancy,yes,,x,x,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

We explore the possibility that spatial or temporal heterogeneity in environmental signalling conditions (in this case light spectrum) may induce fluctuating sexual selection on male behaviour and ornamentation in guppies. We used shade cloth and filters to experimentally manipulate light spectrum, mimicking conditions found naturally: early morning/late afternoon light (SC treatment), midday forest shade (F89 filter treatment) and midday woodland shade (F55 filter treatment). Females were more responsive to male courtship and males were less likely to attempt sneak copulations under F55 light than the other two treatments. By contrast, male display rate was not influenced by treatment. Females tended to prefer the same males under SC and F55 light, but attractiveness in these treatments was unrelated to attractiveness under F89 light. There were similarities among treatments in the traits that females preferred: females preferred males with larger areas of orange in all three treatments. There were, however, also some differences, including preference for larger males under F89 light and for smaller males under the other treatments. Overall, the influence of ambient light spectrum on the relative importance of mate choice and male sneak copulation may have important implications for the mode and strength of sexual selection in different environments. The findings on attractiveness and preference functions, however, suggest that light spectrum only weakly affects the direction of sexual selection by female choice.",not quantitative genetics,Poecilia reticulata,Trinidadian guppies,Actinopterygii,behavioral trails,,not quantitative genetics,no,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Plastic responses, in turn, frequently alter the environment that plants experience. Plants can modify the environment they experience through many mechanisms-some approximate but others quite precise. The ability of plants to modify the environment they experience can strongly influence the evolution of characters expressed subsequently. A review of some theoretical models of habitat selection and of the coevolution of characters and their environments highlights the importance of habitat selection in plants. Novel evolutionary trajectories and outcomes result when organisms are capable of modifying the environment they experience. Specifically, characters can evolve even if they have no genetic variation, and plasticity in environment-determining characters may promote specialization in others. Divergence and reproductive isolation may even be augmented by habitat-selecting behavior in plants.

We investigated the effect of nutrition on the calling song of male field crickets Gryllus campestris. This song is a multicomponent sexually selected signal. Adult males were kept on one of three feeding regimes, which resulted in significant differences in body condition between experimental groups. We found significant increases in calling rate and chirp rate and a significant decrease in interchirp duration with increasing food level. Other song characters, such as chirp duration, syllable number, chirp intensity and carrier frequency, were not affected by the food treatment. Furthermore, carrier frequency was correlated with harp area, which is an index of structural size in adult males.

Such species, among them Glycyphagus privatus and Glycyphagus ornatus show three potential developmental pathways: (1) to bypass the hypopus stage and develop directly from the protonymph to the tritonymph and the subsequent reproductive stage when conditions are favorable; (2) to leave the original site and disperse by means of a phoretic hypopus morph; or (3) to survive inimical life conditions in the natal environment by means of a sedentary hypopus morph. By producing both dispersing (and afterwards at the arrival site reproducing) and sedentary (drought-hardy and dormancy-prone) progeny each single parent attains a selective advantage through a risk-reducing insurance against irregularly fluctuating and often fatal life conditions of their temporary patch habitats. Both genetic heterogeneity and ecological plasticity for hypopus production adapt the Glycyphagus species to cope with variation in the environment. Both traits (for dispersal and survival) are extremely polymorphic with genotypes ranging from low to high propensities for production of each hypopus type. There is a substantial environmental effect on genetic expression such that expression of both morphs depends on the quality of food. This ecological response allows a fast reaction of the mite to the current trophic environment. Phoretic morphs are predominantly expressed at favorable trophic conditions and sedentary morphs at poor trophic conditions. Ecological influences may override genetic propensities and vice versa. Although selection imposed by changing environmental patterns adjusts the frequencies of genotypes over generations and provides for long-term adaptation, the short-term process of environmental induction adapts the population within a generation to transient-habitat disturbances. The interaction of genetic and ecological determinants explains the varying proportions of directly developing mites, phoretic hypopodes, and sedentary hypopodes, in a population at any moment.",genetic and environmental effects on morph,Glycyphagus privatus and G. ornatus,mites,Arachnida,selection lines and reciprocal crosses,reciprocal crosses between selection lines,"mites have three developmental pathways, either skipping a developmental stage, dispersing, or surviving by being sedentary.

Here four replicate lines of house mice artificially selected for high early-age wheel running and their four replicate control lines were used to evaluate the effects of early-age directional selection, genetic drift, and activity environment (presence or absence of a running wheel) on variation in the ontogenies of three traits known to be genetically correlated: voluntary wheel running, body mass, and food consumption. Early-age selection significantly changed both the shape and position of the wheel-running and food-consumption ontogenies while influencing the position, but not the shape, of the body mass ontogeny. Genetic drift (as indicated by variation among replicate lines) produced significant changes in both the position and shape of all three ontogenies; however, its effect differed between the selection and control groups. For wheel running and food consumption, genetic drift only influenced the control ontogenies, whereas for body mass, genetic drift had a significant effect in both selection groups. Both body-mass and food-consumption ontogenies were significantly altered by activity environment, with the environment causing significant changes in the shape and position of both ontogenies. Overall the results demonstrate strong effects of early-age selection, genetic drift, and environmental variation on the evolution and expression of behavioral and morphological ontogenies, with selection changing only the position of the morphological ontogeny but both the position and shape of the behavioral ontogenies.","strong effects of early age selection, genetic drift, and environment on behavioral ontogenies",Mus doemsticus,house mouse,Mammalia,artificial selection lines,selection lines,not useful,no,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH," Mizera, F   Meszena, GAF Mizera, F   Meszena, G"," Spatial niche packing, character displacement and adaptive speciation   along an environmental gradient",5,2003," In this study, we examine the ecology and adaptive dynamics of an asexually reproducing population, migrating along an environmental gradient. The living conditions are optimal at the central location and deteriorate outwards. The different strategies are optimized to the ecological conditions of different locations. The control parameters are the migration and the tolerance of the strategies towards the environmental condition (location). Locally, population growth is logistic and selection is frequency-independent, corresponding to the case of a single limiting resource. The behaviour of the population is modelled by numerically integrated reaction-diffusion equations as well as by individual-based simulations. Limiting similarity, spatial niche segregation and character displacement are demonstrated, analogous to resource-heterogeneity based niche partitioning. Pairwise invasibility analysis reveals a convergent stable singular strategy optimized to the central, optimal location. It is evolutionarily stable if the migration rate and the tolerance are large. Decreasing migration or decreasing tolerance bifurcates the singular strategy to an evolutionary branching point. Individual-based simulation of evolution confirms that, in the case of branching singularity, evolution converges to this singular strategy and branches there. Depending on the environmental tolerance, further branching may occur. The branching evolution in the asexual model is interpreted as a sign that the ecology of an environmental gradient is prone to adaptive geographic speciation.",model of migration behavior,,,,model,,not quantitative genetics,no,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,not human

To test this prediction, we subjected bottlenecked (three-pair founder-flush) and nonbottlenecked populations of the housefly to 18 generations of selection for assortative mating. After the selection regime, we analysed videotaped courtship bouts in these lines to identify correlated responses to the selection protocol. The realized heritabilities for assortative mating for both the bottlenecked and nonbottlenecked treatments were very low, but still significant. The founder-flush populations had thus responded to selection as well as the nonbottlenecked populations, although not significantly greater (i.e. total increases in assortative mating were 9.6 and 8.6%, respectively). Multivariate analyses on the courtship repertoires found that, although both bottlenecked and nonbottlenecked treatments attained similar levels of assortative mating, the treatments exhibited different evolutionary solutions in their correlated responses. Specifically, the bottlenecked lines demonstrated a significantly more diverse set of evolutionary trajectories (i.e. significant shifts along the second principal component for courtship). This suggests that the bottlenecked lines had greater potential for the evolution of novel phenotypes as predicted by founder-induced speciation models. Our results, however, cannot distinguish whether the more variable evolutionary responses resulted from increased heritabilities in courtship components, reduced potential to follow the convergent evolutionary trajectories noted for the nonbottlenecked lines, or some combination of both general processes in determining the resultant multivariate phenotype.",low heritabilities for assortative mating - bottleneck didn't change ability to respond to selection,Musca domestica,housefly,Insecta,bottlenecked and nonbottlenecked populations kept with selection regime,selection lines,"similar responses to selection but different solutions and bottlenecked lines had more diverse evolutionary trajectories, suggesting that bottlenecks had greater potential for evolution of novel phenotypes. good example of quantiative genetics used to test speciation hypothesis",maybe,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Heritabilities were estimated using variance component-based quantitative genetic analyses with much of the genetic information arising from paternal half-sibs.   Results: Individual behaviors reflecting increased distress responses (e.g., vocalizations and teeth grinding) and behavioral inhibition (e.g., latency to leave mother, latency to inspect novel fruit) showed significant heritability, even though a small number of monkeys were assessed. Exploratory factor analyses identified seven clusters of behaviors across tests, some of which were found to be heritable.

 J, ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR," Kamimura, YAF Kamimura, Y"," Effects of repeated mating and polyandry on the fecundity, fertility and   maternal behaviour of female earwigs, Euborellia plebeja",65,2003," I examined multiple mating and its function in female earwigs, Euborellia plebeia (Dermaptera: Anisolabididae). Like other earwigs, females of this species care for their eggs and intermittently lay eggs in clutches (iteroparity). Analysis of two polymorphic allozyme loci revealed that wild-caught adult females laid clutches with low within-brood genetic relatedness (0.210), indicating that females were promiscuous under natural conditions. Rearing experiments in the laboratory revealed that: (1) repeated mating with a single male increased female fecundity (number of clutches laid) and hence the number of hatchlings produced; (2) estimated sperm number was positively correlated with hatchability; (3) when frequency of mating was controlled, polyandry enhanced hatchability, although this effect was not statistically significant; (4). duration of maternal care varied for clutches with low hatchability, and sometimes exceeded the mean interclutch interval. Thus, although a possible benefit of polyandry is suggested, the greater beneficial effect of repeated mating on female fecundity can explain polyandrous mating in this species. Because female earwigs invest considerable effort in brooding their clutches, it may be adaptive to suppress oviposition unless stored sperm ensures high fertility.

 B, AVIAN MIGRATION," Pulido, F   Berthold, PAF Pulido, F   Berthold, P", Quantitative genetic analysis of migratory behaviour,,2003,"Since the very beginning of bird migration research in the early 18th century, a number of intriguing observations have made people doubt whether migration was entirely determined by the environment. For instance, the activity of caged birds deprived of environmental cues during the migratory season, the migration of young birds without experience and without the guidance of their parents (e.g. cuckoos) and the departure from the breeding grounds in summer when conditions on the breeding grounds are still favourable could not be explained without assuming internal factors controlling these behaviours. In the 19th and early 20th century, these and other observations were explained by assuming that migratory birds possess an innate migration instinct. Until the rediscovery of Mendel’s laws and the foundation of modern genetics in the early 20th century, “genetic” research on avian migration was concerned with providing evidence for the existence of this migration instinct, and specifying which components of migratory behaviour are innate and which are acquired by experience or learning. These arguments were exclusively based on observational evidence. In the 1930s first experimental studies were conducted to explore the inheritance of migratory behaviour (e.g. Välikangas 1933; Frieling and Valikangas 1934; Nice 1934, 1937; Putzig 1938), giving birth to the field of genetics of bird migration.",good review of migration in birds and its quantitative genetic basis,Aves,birds,Aves,review,,"use multiple ways to estimate heritability (mid-parent mid-offspring correlation, full-sib, etc), and can identify additive genetic variance vs non-genetic full sib effects.

Human behavior genetics is concerned with partitioning human variation into genetic versus non-genetic variation, and the non-genetic variation is due in part to phenotypic plasticity. Here we examine human phenotypic plasticity from the perspective of evolutionary biology. The question-to what degree is phenotypic plasticity adaptive-has been studied intensively during the past 15 years, but it has been studied almost exclusively in plants and non-human animals. Although the question has usually been asked of examples of plasticity that seem particularly likely to be adaptive, the results of empirical tests have been mixed. These mixed results suggest that many cases of apparently adaptive plasticity might fail to support the adaptive hypothesis when currently accepted methodology is applied. Here we describe the techniques that have been developed to test the adaptive hypothesis, and consider whether any of them can be successfully applied to the study of human phenotypic plasticity. We conclude that while many of the techniques of experimental evolutionary biology cannot be applied to humans, there are methods by which students of human behavior can successfully test the adaptive plasticity hypothesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

The results of variance analysis indicated that OID, PID, and LID were simultaneously controlled by seed nuclear, cytoplasm, and maternal nuclear effects. Genetic effects due to maternal nuclear were relatively more important at whole developmental period. GE interaction effects were the main contribution to the total variation of OID at first two stages, of PID at the forth stage, and of LID across all four stages, respectively.

Quantitative genetics of sexual trade-offs in the   snail Bulinus truncatus,16,2003," Resource allocation is thought to play a key role in the coexistence of different sexual morphs within hermaphroditic species. Indeed, most models assume that sexual functions are subject to a balance between reproductive advantage and energetic cost. Various types of cost (e.g. organ construction, maintenance and utilization) and levels of trade-off (physiological and genetic) may be considered. We here examine physiological and genetic costs of phallus construction and maintenance in Bulinus truncatus, a snail species in which aphallic individuals (without phallus) coexist with regular hermaphrodites. We use a quantitative genetic design involving 37 inbred lines (four populations) known to produce different proportions of aphallics, to test for the existence of genetic and nongenetic correlations between aphally and a range of life-history traits over the totality of the life cycle. Our results show that aphallic and euphallic individuals of the same line do not show consistent differences in either growth, fecundity (including offspring survival), or longevity. Furthermore, none of these traits is genetically correlated across lines with the frequency of the aphallic morph. We conclude that the cost of the construction and maintenance of the phallus must be very low in this species. Future studies should investigate the cost associated with using the phallus ( i.e. male outcrossing behaviour) to explain the maintenance of high frequencies of aphallic individuals in natural populations.",genetic and physiological costs of phallus construction and maintenance - not behavior,Bulinus truncatus,snail,Gastropoda,,,not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 S, NEUROSCIENCES IN THE POSTGENOMIC ERA," Plomin, RAF Plomin, R", Human behavioral genomics,,2003," We are rapidly approaching a postgenomic era in which we will know the entire genome sequence and, most importantly to human behavioral genetics, all the variations in the genome sequence. These DNA polymorphisms are the source of hereditary influence and will revolutionize human behavioral genetics, especially links between genes, brain and behavior.   Attention is now focused on finding genes for complex quantitative traits influenced by multiple genes (called quantitative trait loci, QTLs) as well as environmental factors. Behavioral disorders and dimensions are the most complex of all quantitative traits. Progress in identifying genes for complex traits has been slower than expected in part because research has lacked statistical power to detect genes of small effect size. Research designs are needed that can break the 1% QTL barrier.   Much has been learned and remains to be learned using quantitative genetic techniques that can disentangle genetic and environmental influences. In addition to demonstrating that genetic influence is substantial for most behavioral disorders and dimensions, quantitative genetic techniques can be used to assess genetic and environmental influences on covariance between behavioral traits or between behavioral and biological traits (multivariate genetics), to chart genetic change as well as continuity during development (developmental genetics), and to investigate interactions and correlations between genes and environment (environmental genetics). This research can chart the course for molecular genetic attempts to identify QTLs.   The greatest impact of the postgenomic era on human behavioral genetics research will come after specific genes have been identified that contribute to the ubiquitous heritability of behavioral traits. The future of genetic research lies in moving from finding genes (genomics) to finding out how genes work (functional genomics). Functional genomics is usually considered in terms of bottom-up molecular biology at the cellular level of analysis. However, a top-down behavioral level of analysis (behavioral genomics) might pay off more quickly in predicting, diagnosing, treating and preventing problems. Bottom-up and top-down levels of analysis of gene-behavior pathways will eventually meet in the brain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

If species can arise or remain distinct despite gene flow between them, speciation can only be understood on a gene by gene level. To understand the genetics of speciation, we therefore must identify the targets of selection that cause divergent evolution and identify the genetic architecture underlying such ""speciation phenotypes"". This will enable characterization of genomic regions that are ""free to flow"" between species, and those that diverge in the face of gene flow. We discuss this problem in the genus Laupala, a morphologically cryptic, flightless group of crickets that has radiated in Hawaii. Because songs are used in courtship and always distinguish close relatives of Laupala as well as species in sympatry, we argue that songs in Laupala are speciation phenotypes. Here, we present our approaches to identify the underlying genomic regions and song genes that differentiate closely related species. We discuss what is known about the genetic basis of this species difference derived from classic quantitative genetics and quantitative trait locus mapping experiments. We also present a model of the molecular expression of cricket song to assist in our goal to identify the genes involved in song variation.

However, many behavioral ecologists are uncertain about the value of including a genetic component in their studies. In this article, we review how genetic analyses of behavior are central to topics ranging from understanding past selection and predicting future evolution to explaining the neural and hormonal control of behavior. Furthermore, we review both new and old techniques for studying evolutionary behavior genetics and highlight how the choice of approach depends on both the question and the organism. Topics discussed include genetic architecture, detecting the past history of selection, and genotype-by-environment interactions. We show how these questions are being addressed with techniques including statistical genetics, QTL analyses, transgenic analyses, and microarrays. Many of the techniques were first applied to the behavior of genetic model organisms such as laboratory mice and flies. Two recent developments serve to expand the relevance of such studies to behavioral ecology. The first is to use model organisms for studies of the genetic basis of evolutionarily relevant behavior and the second is to apply methods developed in model genetic systems to species that have not previously been examined genetically. These conceptual advances, along with the rapid diversification of genetic tools and the recognition of widespread genetic homology, suggest a bright outlook for evolutionary genetic studies.

Apart from strong contributions of environmental variance in reducing heritabilities, the additive genetic components can be very low, especially when they are camouflaged by nonadditive genetic effects. We first report the heritabilities of courtship traits in founder-flush and control populations of the housefly (Musca domestica L.). We estimated the heritability of each male and female display through the regression of the courtships involving daughters and sons (with randomly selected mates) onto the ""midparental"" courtship values of their parents. Overall, the average heritability was significantly (P=.012) higher for the parent-daughter assays than for the parent-son assays. We attributed the low (even negative) heritabilities to genotype-by-environment interactions whereby the male's behavior is influenced by the ""environment"" of his mating partner's preferences for the display, generating epistasis through indirect genetic effects. Moreover, bottlenecked lines had up to 800% of the heritability of the controls, suggesting ""conversion"" of additive genetic variance from nonadditive components. Second, we used line-cross assays on separate populations that had been selected for divergence in mating behavior to identify dominance and epistasis through heterosis and outbreeding depression in courtship. Finally, our literature review confirms the prevalence of such low heritabilities (i.e., a conservative mean of 0.38) and nonadditive genetics in other behavioral repertoires (64% of the studies). We conclude that animal behavior is especially prone to the gamut of quantitative genetic complexities that can result in negative heritabilities, negative selection responses, inbreeding depression, conversion, heterosis, and outbreeding depression.",significantly higher heritability for parent-daughter assays than parent-son assays.,Musca domestica,housefly,Insecta,regression of courtships involving daughters and sons onto midparental coursthip values. ,parent-offspring regression,"low heritabilities attributed to GxE, namely his parenter preferences. bottlenecked lines had more heritability than the controls, suggestion conversion of additive gentic variance from nonadditive components",maybe,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,x,not human

Results: We developed multiple ISCR lines for each Lore QTL, in which the QTL interval was broken into a number of smaller intervals. For all four QTLs, we reduced-the size of the interval, in one case,to 3.7 CM.   Conclusions: Use of ISCR lines can narrow each Lore candidate region to a few centimorgans.

Here, I review recent work on variation within and among guppy (Poecilia reticulata) populations in female mate choice and mating preferences. Empirical results demonstrate that there is substantial variation within and among populations in female responsiveness and choosiness, and much of this variation is genetic. Evidence for variation in preference functions also exists, but this appears to be more equivocal and the relative importance of genetic variation is less clear cut. In the second half of this review I discuss the potential significance of this variation to three important evolutionary issues: the presence of multiple male ornaments, the maintenance of polymorphism and divergence in mate recognition among populations. Studies of genetic variation in mate choice within populations indicate that females have complex, multivariate preferences that are able to evolve independently to some extent. These findings suggest that the presence of multiple male ornaments may be due to multiple female mating preferences. The extreme polymorphism in male guppy colour patterns demands explanation, yet no single satisfactory explanation has yet emerged. I review several old ideas and a few new ones in order to identify the most promising potential explanations for future empirical testing. Among these are negative frequency dependent selection, environmental heterogeneity coupled with gene flow, and genetic constraints. Last, I review the relative extent of within and among-population variation in mate choice and mating preferences in order to assess why guppies have not speciated despite a history of isolation and divergence. I argue that variation within guppy populations in mate choice and enhanced mating success of new immigrants to a pool are major impediments to population divergence of the magnitude that would be required for speciation to occur.",genetic variation exists for multivariate female preferences,Poecilia reticulata,Trinidadian guppies,Actinopterygii,review,,substantial variation within and among populations in female responsiveness and choosiness. could be an interesting overview,maybe,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Directional selection favouring increased body sizes is thus predicted in the absence of opposing selection pressure. The evolutionary forces capable of counterbalancing such a 'fecundity advantage' are poorly documented. This study focuses on revealing the costs of large body size in the wingless females of Orgyia antiqua and O. leucostigma, two related species of lymantriid moths. Extreme behavioural simplicity of these animals allows systematic assessment of various fitness components in conditions that are close to natural. A linear relationship between pupal weight and potential fecundity was observed. This association was found to be independent of particular rearing conditions. There was no evidence that the relationship between fecundity and body mass becomes asymptotic when body sizes increases. No component of fitness showed a negative phenotypic correlation with body size; some displayed a weakly positive one. In particular, pupal mortality, adult longevity, mating and oviposition success, as well as egg hatching rate and egg size, were established as independent of body size in a series of field and laboratory experiments. There was a very high overall efficiency of converting resources accumulated during the larval stage to egg masses. With no costs of large adult size, selective forces balancing the fecundity advantage should operate in the course of immature development.

This information, which is otherwise difficult to obtain, can give important insights into the expression and evolution of phenotypic traits. We review the literature to provide examples of how molecular pedigree analysis has been used extensively to examine patterns of distribution, dispersal, and social behaviour in fishes and how it provides a tool for the estimation of quantitative genetic parameters. Although multiple methodologies can be used to examine family structure, the efficacy of any molecular pedigree analysis is generally dependent on prior consideration of interrelated statistical and biological factors. Statistical issues stem from the choice of molecular marker type and marker set used, in addition to sampling strategy. We discuss these considerations and additionally emphasize the utility of supplemental nongenetic data for increasing the efficacy of pedigree analysis. We advocate that, where possible, a priori knowledge of the study system's biology should be used to inform study design and further highlight the need for additional empirical testing of methodologies.",not useful,,,,review,,focus on molecular pedigree analysis,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

There is increasing evidence of the role of heredity in the field of neuropsychiatric disorders in children. So far, only a few pathways between genes and behaviour have been unravelled.   Quantitative genetics puts polygenic inheritance models forward. Molecular genetic research based on these models seems promising, but until now has provided only a limited explanation for the variance in the studied neuropsychiatric disorders. In these models the complexity of the expression of a single gene grows exponentially with the number of genes involved. Consequently, research on the gene-phenotype relationships and phenotypical variability in such models is extremely complex.   The candidate gene approach, in which the gene-phenotype pathway of a single gene is studied, is more manageable, and in our opinion essential in understanding multiple gene models. We discuss recent findings in the field and their relevance for neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Single gene defects will only explain a part of the range of neuropsychiatric disorders in children, but the evidence that this approach can generate may help to clarify neuropsychiatric phenotypes. The discovery of single gene disorders in subgroups of subjects with a neuropsychiatric phenotype may result in new perspectives for their treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human
 J, EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH," Langerhans, RB   DeWitt, TJAF Langerhans, RB   DeWitt, TJ", Plasticity constrained: over-generalized induction cues cause   maladaptive phenotypes,4,2002," The adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity depends upon the degree of match achieved between phenotype and environment. This match is governed in part by how well organisms discern environmental states (e.g. presence or absence of particular predators). To examine the specificity with which organisms use cues to induce defensive phenotypes, we raised freshwater snails, Physella virgata, with either molluscivorous or non-molluscivorous sunfish species (Lepomis cyanellus, L. gibbosus, L. macrochirus, L. megalotis, L microlophus, Micropterus salmoides). Regardless of the predator class with which they were raised, snails exhibited two induced responses: (1) reduced growth and (2) development of rotund shells. Reduced growth typically results from predator avoidance behaviours and so is associated with a net survival benefit in environments containing molluscivores. Rotund shells increase crush resistance and so increase both handling time and rejection rates by molluscivorous sunfish. Despite the adaptive nature of these responses to molluscivorous species, responding unnecessarily to non-molluscivores is maladaptive. Growth reduction limits fecundity and prevents snails from attaining size refugia for most predators. Rotund shells increase vulnerability to shell-entry predators, which are typically more common than shell-crushing predators. Thus the induced responses entail costs but award no advantages in the presence of non-molluscivorous sunfish. Lack of specificity in use of cues (e.g. all sunfish treated alike) may be a major constraint on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. Furthermore, these induced responses may produce trait-mediated indirect effects that cascade throughout the food web.",not behavior,Physella virgata,freshwater snails,Gastropoda,raised indivdiuals with different types of predators,,reduced grwoth or development of rotund shells,no,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,not human

In the marine amphipod Jassa marmorata, males differ in morphology as well as behaviour. This dimorphism corresponds to two contrasting reproductive strategies: small sneaker males or 'minors', and large fighter males or 'majors'. This study uses quantitative genetic analyses in conjunction with experimental manipulations to assess the relative importance of genetic versus environmental factors in the determination and maintenance of these alternative mating strategies. Heritability analyses indicated the reproductive phenotypes do not reflect genetic differences between dimorphic males. By contrast, morph determination was significantly affected by diet quality. Majors essentially only developed on high-protein diets. Field studies also identified a strong correlation between seasonal shifts in the relative proportions of morphs and changes in food (i.e. phytoplankton) quantity and composition, corroborating that diet cues the switch between alternative reproductive tactics. Moreover, the comparison of major and minor growth trajectories identified a heterochronic shift in maturation times between morphs, indicating that ecological selective pressures, rather than just sexual selection, may be involved in the maintenance of this conditional strategy.",alternative male tactics are not genetically different -impacted by diet quality,Jassa marmorata,amphipod,Malacostraca,quantitative genetic analyses and experimental manipulations,F1 cross,importance of condition in maintaining variation,yes,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,x,not human
 J, ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR," Reale, D   Roff, DAAF Reale, D   Roff, DA", Quantitative genetics of oviposition behaviour and interactions among   oviposition traits in the sand cricket,64,2002," We performed a quantitative genetic study of oviposition behaviours and oviposition traits in the sand cricket Gryllus firmus. Egg survival in crickets depends on the depth at which they are inserted into the soil with the ovipositor. We examined whether egg depth depends on ovipositor length alone, or on both morphological and behavioural traits associated with oviposition. Heritability estimates were high (h(z) >0.5) for ovipositor length and small (h(2)=0.2) for oviposition behaviours. Negative genetic correlations between ovipositor length and some behavioural traits (digging depth and the behavioural component of egg depth) indicated compensation between oviposition traits on egg depth. Because of behavioural compensation, females with different ovipositor lengths subject to stabilizing selection on egg depth could have equal fitnesses. Females laid their eggs deeper, and their eggs were marginally more evenly distributed in dry than in wet sand. This suggests adaptive phenotypic plasticity in laying behaviour, but may also result from physical constraints of the substrate on the insertion of the ovipositor. The absence of significant between-family variation in oviposition traits in response to sand moisture indicates low evolutionary potential for phenotypic plasticity in oviposition traits according to soil moisture. In highly unpredictable environments, females could spread the risk of desiccation by laying eggs at different depths independently of environmental conditions (bet hedging). Our results show significant additive genetic influences on the ability of a female to spread risks as measured by genetic variation in egg distribution, suggesting that a bet-hedging strategy of egg laying has the potential to evolve in this population.

Existing studies have concentrated on the repeatability of female preference for the male trait eliciting the highest female response but have rarely dealt with female choosiness and response rate, which are also important traits for the evolution of female choice and can mimic repeatable variation in preference. We used a method devised to disentangle the effects of preference, choosiness and response rate to examine the repeatability of female choice for acoustic signals in the grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus. We stimulated females with artificial courtship signals that varied in one signal trait and recorded the number of acoustic responses of the females in two sessions separated by several days. Using a normal distribution function within a nonlinear regression between signalling trait and female response rate, we independently calculated values for female preference, choosiness and maximum response rate for the two sessions. All three aspects of female choice showed significant repeatability indicating large differences between females. This method will also be suitable for measuring the heritability of female preference, a crucial question regarding the evolution of female choice.

Recent evidence shows that rapid and significant evolution in host-specificity can occur. The risk of non-target use by biological control agents increasing to unacceptable levels through rapid evolution therefore needs to be considered. In addition, weed biological control offers many as yet largely unexploited opportunities for improving our basic understanding of host-specificity and its evolution. We therefore evaluate the evidence that rapid evolution (1) alters the use of existing hosts, and (2) alters the fundamental host-range. Most cited examples of so-called host shifts from weed biological control were not the result of genetic change. There was only limited evidence of genetically altered performance on a non-target host and no evidence of altered fundamental host-range. We conclude, from both theory and the available data, that only altered use of existing hosts (through quantitative genetic changes) needs be considered when evaluating the risk of rapid evolution. Host-specificity testing methodologies can be improved and adapted to better assess the risk of occurrence of post-release evolution.","not useful

 J, CONSERVATION BIOLOGY," Ford, MJAF Ford, MJ", Selection in captivity during supportive breeding may reduce fitness in   the wild,16,2002," I used a quantitative genetic model to explore the effects of selection on the fitness of a wild population subject to supportive breeding. Supportive breeding is the boosting of a wild population's size by breeding part of the population in captivity and releasing the captive progeny back into the wild. The model assumes that a single trait is under selection with different optimum trait values in the captive and wild environments. The model shows that when the captive population is closed to gene flow from the wild population, even low levels of gene flow from the captive population to the wild population will shift the wild population's mean phenotype so that it approaches the optimal phenotype in captivity. If the captive population receives gene flow from the wild, the shift in the wild population's mean phenotype becomes less pronounced but can still be substantial. The approach to the new mean phenotype can occur in less than 50 generations. The fitness consequences of the phenotypic shift depend on the details of the model, but a>30% decline in fitness can occur over a broad range of parameter values. The rate of gene flow between the two environments, and hence the outcome of the model, is sensitive to the wild environment's carrying capacity and the population growth rate it can support. The results have two important implications for conservation efforts. First, they show that selection in captivity may significantly reduce a wild population's fitness during supportive breeding and that even continually introducing wild individuals into the captive population will not eliminate this effect entirely. Second, the sensitivity of the model's outcome to the wild environment's quality suggests that conserving or restoring a population's habitat is important for preventing fitness loss during supportive breeding.",beyond the scope of the article,,,,theoretical model to explore effects of selection on fitness in a wild population with supportive breeding,,conservation not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, HEREDITY," Olson, DM   Andow, DAAF Olson, DM   Andow, DA", Inheritance of an oviposition behavior by an egg parasitoid,88,2002," A quantitative genetic study revealed genetic and environmental sources of variance in percentage parasitism of European corn borer egg masses and secondary sex ratios by Trichogramma nubilale. Full and half-sib groups of T. nubilale were obtained from a nested mating design, which permitted the partitioning of the variance of T. nubilale parasitism of European corn borer egg masses into additive genetic variance, maternal/dominant variance and environmental variance. A mother-daughter regression of the percentage of an egg mass parasitized allowed a determination of the direction of a potential response to selection in the event of maternal effects. No or very little additive genetic effects were associated with the percentage of eggs within a mass parasitized and secondary sex ratios, but a significant amount of the variance for both traits had a maternal and/or dominant genetic source. The relationship between mothers and daughters in egg mass parasitism was positive, and 55.4% of the progeny of a given mother had behaviors that resemble their mother. Most of the variance had an environmental and/or unknown genetic source implying potentially high phenotypic plasticity associated with all these traits.

Estimation of the degree of genetic variance in parental care is important because it can be a significant source of maternal effects, which, if genetically based, represent indirect genetic effects. A major prediction of indirect genetic effect theory is that traits without heritable variation can evolve because of the heritable environmental variation that indirect genetic effects provide. In the dung beetle, Onthophagus taurus, females provide care to offspring by provisioning a brood mass. The size of the brood mass has pronounced effects on offspring phenotype. Using a half-sib breeding design we show that the weight of the brood mass females produce exhibits significant levels of additive genetic variance due to sires. However, variance caused by dams is considerably larger, demonstrating that maternal effects are also important. Body size exhibited low additive genetic variance. However, body size exerts a strong maternal influence on the weight of brood masses produced, accounting for 22% of the nongenetic variance in offspring body size. Maternal body size also influenced the number of offspring produced but there was no genetic variance for this trait. Offspring body size and brood mass weight exhibited positive genetic and phenotypic correlations. We conclude that both indirect genetic effects, via maternal care, and nongenetic maternal effects, via female size, play important roles in the evolution of phenotype in this species.",not behavior,Onthophagus taurus,dung beetle,Insecta,half-sib,half-sib,brood mass weight has significant additive genetic variance but variance caused by dams is higher,no,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,m,,not human

 J, FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY," Dohm, MRAF Dohm, MR", Repeatability estimates do not always set an upper limit to heritability,16,2002," 1. The concept of repeatability, the measurement of consistent individual differences, has become an increasingly important tool in evolutionary and ecological physiology. Significant repeatability facilitates the study of selection acting on natural populations and the concept has several practical implications for identifying traits.   2. When properly defined and measured, repeatability can set the upper limit to heritability. This is potentially a very useful interpretation of the repeatability of traits measured on natural populations because often, estimates of heritability cannot be obtained. Many recent reports of repeatability of individual differences for traits have made this interpretation.   3. However, repeatability estimates may not set an upper limit to heritability if: (a) measured traits are not genetically identical, (b) common environmental effects work in opposition to direct genetic effects, (c) the temporary environments for each trait are negatively correlated, (d) significant genotype-environment interaction is present, or (e) the traits are influenced by maternal effects.   4.

 J, JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY," Stirling, DG   Reale, D   Roff, DAAF Stirling, DG   Reale, D   Roff, DA"," Selection, structure and the heritability of behaviour",15,2002," Characters which are closely linked to fitness often have low heritabilities (V-A' V-p). Low heritabilities could be because of low additive genetic variation (V-A), that had been depleted by directional selection. Alternatively, low heritabilities may be caused by large residual variation (V-R = V-p - V-A) compounded at a disproportionately higher rate than V-A across integrated characters. Both hypotheses assume that each component of quantitative variation has an independent effect on heritability. However, V-A and V-R may also covary, in which case differences in heritability cannot be fully explained by the independent effects of elimination-selection or compounded residual variation.   We compared the central tendency of published behavioural heritabilities (mean = 0.31, median 0.23) with morphological and life history data collected by Mousseau & Roff (1987). Average behavioural heritability was not significantly different from average life history heritability, but both were smaller than average morphological heritability. We cross-classified behavioural traits to test whether variation in heritability was related to selection (dominance, domestic/wild) or variance compounding (integration level). There was a significant three-way interaction between indices of selection and variance compounding, related to the absence of either effect at the highest integration level. At lower integration levels, high dominance variance indicated effects of selection. It was also indicated by the low CVA of domestic species. At the same time CVR increased disproportionately faster than CVA across integration levels, demonstrating variance compounding. However, P neither CVR nor CVA had a predominant effect on heritability. The partial regression coefficients of CVR and CVA on heritability were similar and a path analysis indicated that their (positive) correlation was also necessary to explain variation in heritability. These results suggest that relationships between additive genetic and residual components of quantitative genetic variation can constrain their independent direct effects on behavioural heritability.","compared central tendency fo published behavioral heritabilities with morphological and life history data, a review",,,,review/synthesis,,useul review,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

It has therefore been hypothesised that differences in body temperature resulting from phenotypic properties. such as color pattern. may translate into selection against thermally inferior phenotypes. We tested for costs and benefits of pale versus dark coloration by comparing the behaviors (i.e., basking duration and bouts) of pygmy grasshopper (Tetrix undulata) individuals exposed to experimental situations imposing a trade-off between temperature regulation and feeding. We used pairs consisting of two full-siblings of the same sex that represented different (genetically coded) color morphs but had shared identical conditions from the time of fertilization. Our results revealed significant differences in behavioral thermo regulation between dark and pale individuals in females, but not in males. Pale females spent more time feeding than dark females, regardless of whether feeding was associated with a risk of either hypothermia or overheating. In contrast, only minor differences in behavior (if any) were evident between individuals that belonged to the same color morph but had been painted black or gray to increase and decrease their heating rates. This suggests that the behavioral differences between individuals belonging to different color morphs are genetically determined, rather than simply reflecting a response to different heating rates. To test for effects of acclimation on behaviors, we used pairs of individuals that had been reared from hatchlings to adults under controlled conditions in either low or high temperature. The thermal regime experienced during rearing had little effect on behaviors during the experiments reported above, but significantly influenced the body temperatures selected in a laboratory thermal gradient. In females (but not in males) preferred body temperature also varied among individuals born to mothers belonging to different color morphs, suggesting that a genetic correlation exists between color pattern and temperature preferences. Collectively, these findings, at least in females. are consistent with the hypothesis of multiple-trait coevolution and suggest that the different color morphs represent alternative evolutionary strategies.",significant differences in behavioral thermoregulation based on color morph in females not males,Tetrix undulata,pygmy grasshopper,Insecta,two full-siblings of the same sex with different color morphs but same conditions,full-sib,sex differences in behaviors are genetically determined. consistent with multiple trait coevoltuion,maybe,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,not human

This beetle has facultative cared parents can feed their larvae through regurgitation or digested carrion or offspring can reed by themselves from previously prepared carrion. To investigate larval responses to these two levels of care, including estimates of additive genetic effects, maternal effects, and genotype-by-environment interactions, we used a half-sibling split-family breeding experiment-raising half of the offspring, of a family in the presence of their mother and the other hair without their mother present, Larvae reared with their mother present were on average headier and developed faster, although some of the difference in development decreased or were eliminated by the adult stage. These results suggest that presence or absence of post-hatching maternal care plays an important role in phenotype expression early in life, whereas later the phenotype of the offspring is determined mainly by the genotype and/or unshared environmental effects. Our study also permitted Lis to examine the differences in genetic effects between the two care environments. Heritabilities, maternal/common environment effect, and most genetic correlations did not differ between the care treatments. Genetic analyses revealed substantial additive genetic effects For development time but small effects for measures of body mass. Maternal Plus common environment effects were high for measure,, of mass hut low for development time. suggesting that indirect genetic effects or maternal and/or common environment are less important for the evolution of development time than for mass. Estimates of genetic correlations revealed a trade-off between the duration of the two development stages after the offspring left the carrion. There also a negative genetic correlation between the time spent on carrion and the mass at 72 h, when mothers usually feeding. The analysis of genotype-by-environment interactions indicates substantial among maternal families in response to care. Presence or absence of parental care may therefore contribute to the additive genetic variance through its interaction,with the maternal component of the additive genetic variance. The presence of this interaction further suggests that parent may vary in care strategies, with some parents dispersing after preparation of the carrion and some parents staving with the larvae. This interaction may help maintain genetic variation in growth, development time, and parental care behavior.

 J, HIPPOCAMPUS," Gerlai, RAF Gerlai, R", Hippocampal LTP and memory in mouse strains: Is there evidence for a   causal relationship?,12,2002," The mechanisms underlying memory are under intense investigation. One of the most promising candidates at the cellular level is long-term potentiation (LTP). Numerous pharmacological and molecular genetic manipulations have led to alteration in both LTP and memory. However, the causal relationship between these phenotypical changes is debated. The problem of causality can be addressed in numerous ways. One suggestion is to investigate natural variation in both LTP and memory performance in mouse strains. If variation in synaptic and behavioral phenomena is found, correlation between these traits may be investigated. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach are discussed. An empirical example using four mouse strains is also presented to highlight some general problems. The following arguments are made. First, multiple electrophysiological and behavioral paradigms with idiosyncratic condition characteristics should be conducted to avoid false-positive findings due to alterations unrelated to memory and its mechanisms. Multiple stimulation and memory protocols may also allow one to study the complexity and multiplicity of processes. Second, analysis of a large number of mouse strains may be needed to avoid false interpretation of results due to spurious gene associations and/or linkage disequilibrium.

These traits included length, mass and yolk sac volume at hatching, and size at 'button-up' (the time when yolk is enclosed within the body cavity). There were small differences in size at hatching and size at button-tip among populations (adjusted for egg size). However, sympatric fry grew more rapidly and experienced lower mortality rates during the period of first feeding than allopatric fry. This might indicate behavioural differences between brown trout from the two populations.

Definitions of what constitutes exploration also vary widely. The present article reviews two studies whose results permit a genetic dissection of behaviour displayed in an open-field situation. The results agree that factors representing exploration and stress/fear underlie this type of behaviour. Both factors appear to be linked to neuroanatomical variation in the sizes of the hippocampal intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fibre terminal fields.

Mice from four replicate lines selected for high wheel-running activity ran over twice as many revolutions per day on activity wheels as did mice from four replicate control lines. At approximately 49 days of age, all mice were placed individually in cages with access to wheels and monitored for 6 days, after which wheels were prevented from rotating for the ""sedentary"" individuals. During the experiment, five feeding trials were conducted and body mass was measured weekly. After 8 weeks, body composition was measured by hydrogen isotope dilution. Across the five feeding trials, mice in the ""active"" group (wheels free to rotate) consumed 22.4% more rood than mice in the ""sedentary"" group (wheels locked); mice from the selected lines consumed 8.4% more food than mice from the control lines (average of all trials; body mass-corrected values).

Yet theoretical approaches that incorporate diversity into classical ecosystem theory do not provide a general dynamic theory based on mechanistic principles. In this paper, we suggest that approaches developed for quantitative genetics can be extended to ecosystem functioning by modeling the means and variances of phenotypes within a group of species. We present a framework that suggests that phenotypic variance within functional groups is linearly related to their ability to respond to environmental changes. As a result, the long-term productivity for a group of species with high phenotypic variance may be higher than for the best single species, even though high phenotypic variance decreases productivity in the short term, because suboptimal species are present. In addition, we find that in the case of accelerating environmental change, species succession in a changing environment may become discontinuous. Our work suggests that this phenomenon is related to diversity as well as to the environmental disturbance regime, both of which are affected by anthropogenic activities. By introducing new techniques for modeling the aggregate behavior of groups of species, the present approach may provide a new avenue for ecosystem analysis.",not relevant,,,,statistical method,,propose extending quantiative genetics approaches into ecosystem functioning,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

The genetic basis of this variation is of interest because the elaboration of mating preferences requires additive genetic variation in these traits. Here we measure the repeatability and heritability of two components of female choosiness (responsiveness and discrimination) and of female preference functions for the multiple ornaments borne by male guppies (Poecilia reticulata). We show that there is significant repeatable variation in both components of choosiness and in some preference functions but not in others. There appear to be several male ornaments that females find uniformly attractive and others for which females differ in preference. One consequence is that there is no universally attractive male phenotype. Only responsiveness shows significant additive genetic variation. Variation in responsiveness appears to mask variation in discrimination and some preference functions and may be the most biologically relevant source of phenotypic and genetic variation in mate-choice behavior. To test the potential evolutionary importance of the phenotypic variation in mate choice that we report, we estimated the opportunity for and the intensity of sexual selection under models of mate choice that excluded and that incorporated individual female variation. We then compared these estimates with estimates based on measured mating success.

One phenotype that has aroused a great deal of interest is the behavioral trait hyperactivity and the related clinical disorder attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The driving force behind the molecular genetic research in this area is the overwhelming evidence from quantitative genetic studies that show high heritablility (h(2) = 0.7-0.9) for the behaviors characterizing the diagnosis of ADHD, whether the disorder is viewed as a categorical entity or a continuous trait. To date, molecular studies have aimed at identifying susceptibility genes for ADHD, defined using operational diagnostic criteria, and have focused on variation within genes that regulate dopamine neurotransmission. Several studies report ADHD to be associated with the 7-repeat allele of a 48 bp repeat polymorphism (DRD4-7) in exon 3 of the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4).

Subsequently these strains were selected to perform a quantitative genetic analysis and full genome scan for seminal vesicle and testis weights. Al Fg population was generated. The quantitative genetic analyses indicated that each was linked to several genes. Sixty-six short sequences for length polymorphism were used as markers in the wide genome scan strategy. For weight of paired testes, heritability was 82.3% of the total variance and five QTL contributed to 72.8% of the total variance. Three reached a highly significant threshold (>4.5) and were mapped on chromosome X (LOD score 9.11), chromosome 4 (LOD score 5.96), chromosome 10 (LOD score 5.81); two QTL were suggested: chromosome 13 (LOD score 3.10) and chromosome 18 (LOD score 2.80).

The distance of this QTL to the centromere encompassed the distance of the QTL linked with testicular weight on chromosome 4, suggesting common genetic mechanisms as expected from col relations in the F-2. Both testis and seminal vesicle weights were associated with a reduction in the NZB/BINJ when this strain carried the y(NPAR) from CBA/H whereas the Y-NPAR from NZB/BINJ in the CBA/H strain did not modify reproductive organ weights, indicating that the Y-NPAR interacts with the non-Y-NPAR genes.

Why females of many species mate with multiple males is therefore enigmatic, especially given that costs associated with remating ha iie been well documented. Recently it has been argued that females may remate at a maladaptive rate as an outcome of sexually antagonistic coevolution: the evolutionary tug-of-war between manipulation by one sex and resistance to being manipulated by the other sex. We tested this hypothesis experimentally for the evolution of the female remating interval in a naturally promiscuous species, Drosophila melanogaster. In two replicate populations, sexual selection was removed through enforced monogamous mating with random mate assignment, or retained in polyandrous controls. Monogamy constrains the reproductive success of mates to be identical, thereby converting prior conflicts between mates into opportunities for mutualism. Under these experimental conditions, the sexually antagonistic coevolution hypothesis generates explicit predictions regarding the direction of evolutionary change in female remating behaviour. These predictions are contingent upon the mechanism of male manipulation, which may be mediated biochemically by seminal fluids or behaviourally by courtship. Levels of divergence in female remating interval across lines, and in male ejaculatory and courtship effects on female remating, were quantified after 84 generations of selection. Data refute the hypothesis that the evolutionary change in female remating behaviour was due to sexually antagonistic coevolution of courtship signal and receiver traits. The data were, however, consistent with a hypothesis of sexual conflict mediated through ejaculate manipulation. Monogamy-line males evolved ejaculates that were less effective in inducing female non-receptivity and monogamy-line females evolved to remate less frequently, symptomatic of lowered resistance to ejaculate manipulation. The consistency of the results with alternative hypotheses to explain female promiscuity are discussed.",female remating rate - not quantitative genetics,Drosophila melanogaster,fruit fly,Insecta,enforced monogamy in replicate populations and quantified levels of divergence in female remating interval,,found no evidence for sexually antagonistic coevolution of courtship signal and receiver traits but were consistent with sexual conflict mediated through ejaculate manipulation,no,,x,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

To gain insight into processes that may lead to diversification we examined the genetic architecture underlying the production of the sex pheromone of the cabbage looper moth, Trichoplusia ni. We compared genetic parameters of two populations; one with a wild-type pheromone phenotype (N) and one where a single-gene mutation affecting the pheromone blend produced by females had been established (M). Using a half-sib breeding design we estimated heritabilities, coefficients of additive genetic variation, and phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations of the pheromone components. In both populations, narrow sense heritabilities were generally moderate and genetic correlations were mostly positive. Comparisons between the two populations showed that, while the pattern of phenotypic correlations showed significant agreement between populations, the patterns of genetic (co)variation (i.e. the shapes of the within population matrix) were dissimilar between the two populations. The presence of additive genetic variation in both populations indicates that there is the potential for further evolution of individual pheromone components. However, because of the differences between the populations in the pattern of genetic variation and covariation, the populations will evolve along different evolutionary trajectories even under identical selection pressures.

Transposon tagging in a highly inbred strain of flies in combination with a rapid and simple statistical behavioral assay enables the identification of not only large phenotypic effects, but also small aberrations from wild-type avoidance behavior. The recent completion of the sequence of the Drosophila genome facilitates the molecular characterization of transposon-tagged genes and correlation between gene expression and behavior in smell-impaired (smi) mutant lines. Quantitative genetic analyses of a collection of smi lines In a co-isogenic background revealed an extensive network of epistatic interactions among genes that shape the olfactory avoidance response.

For natural selection to cause evolutionary change in a trait, variation in the trait must be correlated with fitness and be genetically heritable and there must be no genetic constraints to evolution. These conditions have rarely been tested in human populations. In this study, data from a large twin cohort were used to assess whether selection Will cause a change among women in contemporary Western population for three life-history traits: age at menarche, age at first reproduction, and age at menopause. We control for temporal variation in fecundity (the ""baby boom"" phenomenon) and differences between women in educational background and religious affiliation. University-educated women have 35% lower fitness than those with less than seven years education, and Roman Catholic women have about 20% higher fitness than those of other religions. Although these differences were significant, education and religion only accounted for 2% and 1% of variance in fitness, respectively. Using structural equation modeling, we reveal significant genetic influences for all three life-history traits, with heritability estimates of 0.50, 0.23, and 0.45, respectively. However, strong genetic covariation with reproductive fitness could only be demonstrated for age at first reproduction, with much weaker covariation for age at menopause and no significant covariation for age at menarche. Selection may, therefore, lead to the evolution of earlier age at first reproduction in this population. We also estimate substantial heritable variation in fitness itself, with approximately 39% of the variance attributable to additive genetic effects, the remainder consisting of unique environmental effects and small effects from education and religion. We discuss mechanisms that could be maintaining such a high heritability for fitness. Most likely is that selection is now acting on different traits from which it did in pre-industrial human populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Male plants produce many short-lived flowers, whereas females produce few flowers that remain connected with the plant after fertilization. We investigated how variation in flower production and flower longevity affects the infection risk for males and females.   3 In glasshouse experiments, we varied the number of flowers inoculated (4 vs. 16 per plant) with spores and the time until these flowers were removed(1 or 2 days for both sexes, 14 days for females only). We also measured the longevity of male flowers receiving simulated visits, with or without spores, to test for an abscission response to visitation and/or contamination. In a field survey, we measured male and female disease prevalence in 17 natural populations.   4 Varying the number of inoculated flowers did not affect infection probability, but females retaining inoculated flowers for 14 days became diseased more often (20.0%) than did plants with flowers removed within 2 days (7.3%).   5 Males that had dropped more inoculated flowers prematurely were more likely to remain uninfected. Spore-bearing visits shortened male flower longevity (38.4 +/- 2.8 h) relative to non-spore visits (47.9 +/- 5.2 h).   6 Female field disease prevalence (19.7 +/- 3.5%) was higher than that of males (14.3 +/- 2.6%), especially in populations with a high disease incidence.   7 Continuing physical connection during fruit ripening appears to increase invasion time and thus the per-contact infection risk in females. This is consistent with higher female field prevalences, although other explanations, unrelated to disease transmission, are possible.

Progress in the next decade promises to be at least as rapid, and strategies for fine-mapping QTLs and identifying underlying genes will be radically revised. In this Commentary we address several key issues: first, we revisit a perennial challenge-how to identify individual genes and allelic variants underlying QTLs. We compare current practice and procedures in QTL analysis with novel methods and resources that are just now being introduced. We argue that there is no one standard of proof for showing QTL = gene; rather, evidence from several. sources must be carefully assembled until there is only one reasonable conclusion. Second, we compare QTL analysis with whole-genome mutagenesis in Mice and point out some of the strengths and weakness of both of these phenotype-driven methods. Finally, we explore the advantages and disadvantages of naturally occurring vs mutagen-induced polymorphisms.

North American garter snakes and their allies provide a model system for investigating evolutionary quantitative genetics, but estimates of quantitative genetic parameters in these snakes are mostly based on offspring-dam regression and full-sib analysis, methods that fail to discriminate between maternal genetic, maternal environmental, and direct genetic effects on traits of interest. Using data from the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis, we demonstrate that microsatellite DNA markers can be used to identify full-sib sireships within litters in species that produce large numbers of offspring and in which multiple paternity is common. This allows estimation of quantitative genetic parameters using a maternal half-sib analysis in which sires are nested within dams. Six microsatellite DNA loci were scored for four wild-caught dams and their 73 offspring and revealed two full-sib sireships within each litter.

The composites showed a gradual change in electrical resistivity with applied pressure within percolation threshold region at a constant temperature. This type of gradual fall of resistivity with applied pressure is very important to fabricate pressure sensors. Various amounts of carbon particles were dispersed in a rubber matrix to understand the effect of volume fraction of conductive filler with applying external pressure on resistivity. A quantitative general effective media (GEM) theory was used to understand the resistivity of carbon-rubber composites system over a large range of volume fraction of carbon with applied pressure. The use of two different sizes of silicon rubber particles showed a significant effect in gradual fall of resistivity with applied pressure in the narrow range of percolation threshold. However, a large variation in resistivity from Ist measuring to 10th measuring was observed. A significant improvement in successive measuring of resistivity variation from 1st measuring to 10th measuring was observed when composites were fabricated in hexane solvent media. Finally, nano-sized Al2O3 was dispersed to control the resistivity variation upon successive measurement and to improve the mechanical properties of the composites.

Stabilizing viability selection acts equally on both sexes in the case of a sexually monomorphic trait and on males only in the case of a dimorphic trait. A genetically fixed sensory or perceptual bias defines the origin of the scale on which the trait is measured, and the possibility is incorporated that female preferences may deviate asymmetrically from the familiar-either toward or away from this origin. When viability selection is strong relative to sexual selection, the models predict that the mean trait value will evolve to the viability optimum. With intermediate ratios of the strength of viability to sexual selection, a stable equilibrium can occur on either side of this viability optimum, depending on the direction of asymmetry in female preferences. When viability selection is relatively weak and certain other conditions are also satisfied, runaway selection is predicted.",model of a trait udner viability and sexual selection - with sensory bias. runaway selection happens when viability selection is relatively weak,,,,model,,sexual selection model - I should read it even if it's 'not useful for this paper,yes,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 S, HYPOXIA: FROM GENES TO THE BEDSIDE," Garland, TAF Garland, T", Phylogenetic comparison and artificial selection - Two approaches in   evolutionary physiology,502,2001," Interspecific comparison has a long and productive history in physiology. Conceptual and statistical advances over the last 15 years have demonstrated several ways in which comparisons can be enhanced by consideration of phylogenetic information, i.e., empirical estimates of the ways in which organisms are related (evolutionary trees). Choice of species to be compared should be informed by phylogenetic information. For example, a comparison of three species that inhabit high altitude with three that live at low altitude would be suspect if each of the two groups were composed of closely-related species (e.g., within single genera). To avoid such ""phylogenetic pseudoreplication,"" one might instead study species from three different genera, each containing one high-altitude and one low-altitude inhabitant. Unfortunately, many studies have not been so carefully designed, sometimes because organisms were not accessible or because the studies incorporated data from the literature. Fortunately, several new statistical methods correct for problems caused by phylogenetic relatedness and descent with modification, the most common being phylogenetically independent contrasts. Another tool that can be used in comparative physiology is selective breeding, which has been practiced for millennia and applied in scientific contexts for over a century. In the last 20 years, ecological and evolutionary physiologists have begun using selection experiments to study processes of genetic adaptation in physiological and behavioral traits. For example, house mice have been maintained in the cold for multiple generations to see what adaptations may occur naturally in response to reduced ambient temperature (""laboratory natural selection""). Our own laboratory has used selective breeding to create four replicate lines of mice that exhibit high levels of voluntary wheel-running behavior, as well as various morphological and physiological characteristics that cause or allow the elevated locomotor activity. Similar experiments could be used to study adaptation to hypoxia.",not behavior,,,,,,not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Reviewing data from several studies, we consider experiential, biological, and generic factors as providing causal input to typical developmental variation in fearfulness and anxiety during infancy and early childhood. Longitudinal behavioral methods, psychophysiologic measures, and a behavior-genetic framework are used to approach these issues. Results from twin studies implicate moderately strong genetic influences on different facets of temperamental fearfulness, as well as childhood anxiety symptoms. Then, we consider the dis tinction between normal range temperament and overt anxiety symptoms from a quantitative generic perspective. Biological correlates (cortisol, asymmetric frontal EEG activation cardiac reactivity) of inhibited behavior are considered as I-elated endophenotypes for anxiety. In a nongenetic analysis, we report the prediction of internalizing problems during kindergarten from earlier temperament and earlier basal cortisol measures.

Considerable within-population variability of locomotor performance traits has been shown to exist in several species of squamate reptiles. In general, high values for speed and endurance are thought to have positive effects on the ability to capture prey, escape from predators, compete with conspecifics and acquire mates. On the other hand, variation in performance might trade-off with other components of fitness such that the net effect on Darwinian fitness is unpredictable.   2. Gravid females of the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara) were captured and several phenotypic traits of their offspring measured immediately following birth. These were endurance, body length and body mass. Offspring were marked for individual identification, released into the field, and correlations between the phenotypic traits and their subsequent growth, activity and survival rate over the next months were then tested for. Parasitism by hematozoa was monitored and predation risk by tail losses estimated.   3. It was found that individuals with a low endurance at birth tended to have reduced activity and growth rate, and higher parasite load; on the positive side, however, they experienced lower predation risk as assessed by tail losses. Conversely, individuals with a high endurance at birth had high activity and growth rates, low parasite load, but higher incidence of broken tails. Finally, endurance at birth was not correlated with survivorship up to the age of sexual maturity. Thus, individuals with varying locomotor endurance seem to exhibit behaviours that may result in the same level of Darwinian fitness.   4. The possibility that our results reveal a trade-off between the risk of becoming infected with parasites when lizards are less active (which is related to having lower endurance) vs the risk of being predated when the lizards are more active (higher endurance) is discussed.","measured endurance and growth rates and found that low endurance at birth resulted in reduced activity and higher paraiste lod, but lower predation -- not quantitative genetics",Lacerta vivipara,lizard,Reptilia,monitored lizards over lifetime,,not quantitative genetics,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY," Witting, LAF Witting, L", Population cycles caused by selection by density dependent competitive   interactions,62,2000," Several animal species have cyclic population dynamics with phase-related cycles in life history traits such as body mass, reproductive rate, and pre-reproductive period. Although many mechanisms have been proposed there is no agreement on the cause of these cycles, and no population equation that deduces both the abundance and the life history cycles from basic ecological constraints has been formulated. Here I deduce a population dynamic equation from the selection pressure of density dependent competitive interactions in order to explain the cyclic dynamics in abundance and life history traits. The model can explain cycles by evolutionary changes in the genotype or by plastic responses in the phenotype. It treats the population dynamic growth rate as an initial condition, and its density independent fundament is Fisher's (1930, The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, Oxford: Clarendon) fundamental theorem of natural selection that predicts a hyper-geometrical increase in abundance. The predicted periods coincide with the cyclic dynamics of Lepidoptera, and the Calder hypothesis, which suggests that the period of population cycles is proportional to the 1/4 power of body mass, follows from first principles of the proposed density dependent ecology.

We are using artificial selection for increased wheel-running behavior to study the correlated evolution of locomotor activity and physiological determinants of exercise capacity in house mice. We studied enzyme activities and their response to voluntary wheel running in mixed hindlimb muscles of mice from generation 14, at which time individuals from selected lines ran more than twice as many revolutions per day as those from control (unselected) lines. Beginning at weaning and for 8 wk, we housed mice from each of four replicate selected lines and four replicate control lines with access to wheels that were free to rotate (wheel-access group) or locked (sedentary group). Among sedentary animals, mice from selected lines did not exhibit a general increase in aerobic capacities: no mitochondrial [except pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)] or glycolytic enzyme activity was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in control mice. Sedentary mice from the selected lines exhibited a trend for higher muscle aerobic capacities, as indicated by higher levels of mitochondrial (cytochrome-e oxidase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase, citrate synthase, and PDH) and glycolytic (hexokinase and phosphofructokinase) enzymes, with concomitant lower anaerobic capacities, as indicated by lactate dehydrogenase (especially in male mice). Consistent with previous studies of endurance training in rats via voluntary wheel running or forced treadmill exercise, cytochrome-e oxidase, citrate synthase, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity increased in the wheel-access groups for both genders; hexokinase also increased in both genders. Some enzymes showed gender-specific responses: PDH and lactate dehydrogenase increased in wheel-access male but not female mice, and glycogen phosphorylase decreased in female but not in male mice. Two-way analysis of covariance revealed significant interactions between line type and activity group; for several enzymes, activities showed greater changes in mice from selected lines, presumably because such mice ran more revolutions per day and at greater velocities. Thus genetic selection for increased voluntary wheel running did not reduce the capability of muscle aerobic capacity to respond to training.",aritifical selection for wheel running behavior -- not really very relevant,Mus musculus,mouse,Mammalia,multi generation selection for exercise,selection lines,not particularly relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

At generation 17, mice from the four replicate selected lines ran, on average, 2.5-times as many revolutions/day as did mice from the four random-bred control lines.   2. During the day, repeatability of individual differences in body temperature measured 4 days apart was low; at night, repeatability was statistically significant across three time scales (1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks).   3. During the day, body temperatures of selected and control animals did not differ; at night, mice from selected lines had higher body temperatures. However, when amount of wheel running immediately prior to measurement was included as a covariate, the difference was no longer statistically significant.   Higher body temperatures, associated with increased activity, might enhance locomotor abilities through Q10 effects, increase metabolic rate and food requirements, affect sleep patterns, and alter expression of heat-shock proteins.

To gain insight into the extent of adaptation and evolutionary changes in response to environmental heterogeneity in this species, quantitative genetic analyses of life-history variation were conducted for two natural populations under two thermal conditions (23 degrees C and 28 degrees C). Paternal half-sib heritability and genetic correlation in six life-history traits (i.e. development time, adult body weight, adult lifespan, age at first reproduction, the number of eggs laid during the first 5 days after emergence, and total fecundity) were compared. Significant heritabilities were shown consistently in development time; this is also true for adult body weight, except for the Canberra population at 23 degrees C. However, neither population differences nor the effect of temperature were statistically detectable for any of these heritabilities, confirming thr generically determined flexibility. Positive genetic correlations between development time and adult body weight, and negative genetic correlations between the number of eggs laid during the first 5 days and adult lifespan were present for these populations at both temperatures, indicating the presence of genetic constraints. Pairwise comparisons of genetic correlations revealed the heterogeneity of the mio populations and across temperatures.

However, it had not been satisfactorily described until 1988, when we first became able to obtain and analyze video recordings of this behaviour made in infrared light. Thanks to refined video and reproduction techniques, we are now able to present such recordings here, for the first time in printed form (Figs. 1 and 2). The birds involved are first year Blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) from southern Germany during their first migration period. According to our experience, the migratory restlessness they show is typical, i.e. not affected by the recording procedure. In the Blackcap - as shown previously for Garden Warblers - by far the most prominent element in this behaviour is typical ""wing whirring"": beating the wings while perched, with high frequency and low amplitude. We interpret this ""sedentary migration"" as a kind of ""flying with the brakes on"" in adaptation to cage conditions. Migratory restlessness, which in addition to whirring includes hopping, climbing, fluttering and flying, is exhibited in all parts of the cage, not only on the perches but also on the floor and walls and even while hanging from the ceiling. Hence theoretically it can be monitored in its entirety only by ultrasound, video technology, bundles of light barriers or cages rigged for general vibration detection. When applied to many experimental animals, however, these methods require elaborate equipment and are susceptible to failure. In our experience the best results are obtained with recording cages having two movable perches mounted on microswitches. If the switch sensitivity is adjusted to the birds' body weight, about 95 % of the migratory restlessness observed in video pictures will be recorded. Because of the large interindividual variation in the parts of the cage where the relevant behaviour occurs and the variability in use of the recording perches, the best measure for quantitative studies of migratory restlessness is not the number of individual events (""hops"") but larger-scale units such as half- or whole-hour periods with (or without) migratory activity.

 J, POPULATION AND DEVELOPMENT REVIEW," Foster, CAF Foster, C", The limits to low fertility: A biosocial approach,26,2000," In light of 30 years of below-replacement fertility in many industrialized societies, demographers are asking whether fertility could drop even further, or whether there is a ""floor"" below which it will not fall. A key unanswered question is whether there may be a variable biological component to fertility motivation which ensures that we continue to reproduce. Drawing on evidence from evolutionary biology, ethology, quantitative genetics, developmental psychobiology, and psychology, the article argues that our evolved biological predisposition is toward nurturing behaviors, rather than having children per se. Humans have the unique ability to be aware of such biological predispositions and translate them into conscious, but nevertheless biologically based, fertility motivation. It is likely that we have already reached the limits to low fertility since this ""need to nurture,"" in conjunction with normative pressures, ensures that the majority of women will want to bear at least one child.

We treated individual swimming behaviour as a threshold character and used directional changes in average clonal depth within experimental tubes as a test for character plasticity. We compared the swimming behaviours of two cohabiting, phenotypically similar Daphnia (Daphnia galeata and Daphnia galeata-Daphnia rosea hybrid) to determine (1) whether there is inherited variation (H-2) for different traits (responses to hunger and predator cues); (2) whether changes in genetic parameters (norm of reaction and character state) across four environments could be simulated by combinations of the presence or absence of a predator cue and high or low hunger levels; and (3) whether these Daphnia would respond to directional selection, particularly in a trade-off environment thigh hunger and predator cue treatments). Responses of both D. galeata and the D. galeata- rosea hybrid to hunger and a predator cue and the trade-off environment were plastic. Daphnia galeata expressed significant genetic variation within (H-2) and between environments (heritability of plasticity): Both the character state and norm of reaction estimates of heritable variation in the hybrid were close to zero. Genetic correlations were positive and stable across six environmental pairs in Daphnia galeata. Most hybrid genetic correlations were not significant. The phenotypic distributions of both D. galeata and the hybrid were bimodal in the trade-off environment. The D. galeata distribution was partly due to between-clone variation and the hybrid distribution was almost entirely due to within-clone variation. Genetic variation expressed by D. galeata in the trade-off environment appears to depend on both clone by environment interactions and stable inherited differences. These results indicate that while plastic phenotypic responses cause a similar opportunity for selection in D. galeata and the hybrid, their responses to selection would be different in;the trade-off and in related environments.

Correlated responses to selection indicated positive genetic correlations with body weight, nest-building at 4 +/- 1 degreesC, and litter size and negative genetic correlations with food consumption. At generation 46, the replicate high-selected (High 1 x High 2), randomly bred control (Control 1 x Control 2), and low-selected (Low 1 x Low 2) lines were crossed and the F-1 showed significant heterosis for nest-building behavior. Regression of the F-3 On the F-1 generation gave heritability estimates of 0.16 +/- 0.10 for the high and 0.07 +/- 0.10 for the low cross, revealing a potential to break the selection limit (at least in the high direction), which had been reached at about 20 generations of selection. Indeed, renewed selection resulted in responses in both the high and the low directions of nesting, yielding realized heritabilities of 0.29 +/- 0.02 and 0.30 +/- 0.004, respectively. Replicated renewed selection, using the F-3 generation as the base population, in the high direction of nesting resulted in correlated increases in nest-building at 4 +/- 1 degreesC, litter size, and food consumption. Body weight did not change. The positive correlation with food consumption is opposite in sign compared to the original selection experiment.

We studied the variance and covariance of several size and growth variables as well as age and size at maturity by means of population crosses, full-sib analysis, and parent-offspring regressions. We found that the phenotypic differences among these populations are almost entirely due to environmental effects. However, within populations, additive genetic and maternal effects explain most of the variation. We discuss possible explanations for the lack of genetic differences among the populations and speculate that a similar reaction norm is maintained in all populations through heterogeneity in the temporal or spatial environment that the populations experience. The heterogeneity may be mediated through population density fluctuations, climatic variation, or variation in site productivity. Thus, we hypothesize that M. pennsylvanicus has evolved to be the best in all possible worlds rather than in one actual world.

The sample included 120 identical and same-sex fraternal twin pairs (M age = 43 months). Data sources included in-home observations, interviews, and parents' reports. Observers' ratings of children's difficult behaviors included shared and nonshared environmental variance. In contrast, parents' ratings of children's conduct problems showed genetic and nonshared environmental variance. Observer-rated maternal behavior included shared and nonshared environmental variance, although maternal responsiveness also included child genetic variance. Parent self-reported negative and positive affect included shared and nonshared environment as well as child genetic variance. There was no evidence for gene-environment interaction or dominance. Higher levels of difficult behavior and conduct problems covaried with higher levels of maternal negative affect and control and lower levels of maternal positive affect and control. Shared environmental mediation of these correlations was found for observations, whereas genetic and nonshared environmental mediation was found for parents' ratings. in general, estimates of shared environmental variance and mediation were greatest for observational data, and estimates of child genetic variance and mediation were greatest for parent-rated data.

 J, ECOLOGY," van Tienderen, PHAF van Tienderen, PH", Elasticities and the link between demographic and evolutionary dynamics,81,2000," Multivariate selection models and demographic matrix projections are closely related. The subtle differences among the parameters of both approaches (sensitivities, elasticities, selection differentials, and gradients) can be confusing. I suggest a hierarchical framework for analysis using elasticity path diagrams, ""elastograms."" The framework combines selection analysis fur the links between phenotypic traits (morphology, behavior) and fitness components (vital rates) with matrix analysis for the relationship between fitness components and population growth rate/fitness.   Elasticities are often used to quantify the impact of a transition rate in the projection matrix on the population growth rate (lambda). Elasticities fur underlying fitness components such as fecundity and survival rates can be derived from their connection with the transition matrix entries. Yet other traits may affect lambda due to a functional relationship with one or more components of fitness: for instance, the timing of flowering of a plant may affect its seed yield. Elasticities can also be used to quantity the effects of such traits: they can be interpreted as selection gradients for traits expressed on a proportional (mean-standardized) scale. ""Evolvabilities"" (additive genetic variation in mean-standardized traits), rather than the heritabilities of traits, are needed to predict expected selection responses from the elasticities.   Elasticities quantify the direct effect of a focal trait on lambda. integrated elasticities measure the impact of a trait through both its direct and indirect effects. This requires knowledge of the correlations among traits. Matrix projections and selection analysis (through multiple regression or path analysis) can be merged into an elasticity path diagram that summarizes the hierarchical relationships among traits and fitness. Such diagrams facilitate the identification of those traits that have the highest impact on the life cycle of the study organism and can be a tool to define the targets of management practices, as well as an aid in comparative life history research.","probably not relevant

It addresses three major questions regarding physiological evolution: (a) What are the historical, ecological, and phylogenetic patterns of physiological evolution? (b) How important are and were each of the known evolutionary processes (natural selection, sexual selection, drift, constraint, genetic coupling/hitchhiking, and others) in engendering or Limiting physiological evolution? and(c) How do the genotype, phenotype, physiological performance, and fitness interact in influencing one another's future values? To answer these questions, evolutionary physiology examines extant and historical variation and diversity, standing genetic and phenotypic variability in populations, and past and ongoing natural selection in the wild. Also, it manipulates genotypes, phenotypes, and environments of evolving populations in the laboratory and field.

Although males provide no direct, somatic benefits to their mates, females prefer males whose signal characters are more exaggerated than the population means. Previous studies showed that the signal characters influencing mate attraction are highly repeatable and heritable. We measured the phenotypic and additive genetic variances (heritability) of female preference in A. grisella, as this additive genetic variance is one of the genetic assumptions of indirect models of sexual selection. We determined the preference index of female A. grisella by repeated phonotaxis trials in which a choice of simulated male signals was presented. These playback experiments showed that female preference indices varied but were repeatable within individuals. Specifically, females differ in the relative importance of the several signal characters during mate assessment. A subsequent half-sib breeding design revealed an amount of additive genetic variance for the female preference index (h(s)(2) = 0.212, SE = 0.1347, P = 0.0611; CVA = 0.1826).

This parameter reflects spontaneous activity exhibited under standard lighting and housing conditions and, therefore, differs conceptually from assessments of exploratory or open-field activity, voluntary wheel-running, or circadian period during exposure to constant light or constant darkness conditions. We recently observed a greater daily amplitude of oscillation in spontaneous locomotor activity in C57BL/6 mice compared to BALB/cBy mice. To identify genetic loci with potential linkage to circadian variation in the amount of locomotor activity, we measured the spontaneous activity of 13 CXB recombinant inbred (RI) strains of mice.

To determine whether colour morphs differ in thermal physiology, I assessed reaction distance and jumping performance of individuals belonging to different morphs at two different temperatures. Individuals allowed a potential predator to approach less closely and jumped longer distances at high than at low temperature. My analyses also uncovered variation among morphs in average reaction distance and jumping capacity, as well as in thermal sensitivity of these two traits. Matrix correlation analysis further revealed that pair-wise differences between morphs in thermal sensitivity of jumping performance (but not reaction distance) could be accurately predicted by differences in body temperatures preferred in a laboratory thermal gradient. These results support the view that morphology, behaviour and thermal physiology of ectotherms may evolve in concert. The relationship between reaction distance and jumping performance varied among colour morphs at high temperature, and the common within-morph relationship between these two traits deviated from the corresponding among-morph relationship. This suggests chat the variation among morphs has partially arisen through active divergence, with selection having influenced both traits and modifications having occurred to different degrees in different morphs. My data further suggest that pale colour morphs, with a limited capacity to attain high body temperatures, may not necessarily be at a selective disadvantage, because their physiology may be adapted to lower body temperatures.",genetic discrete variation in colors - assessed differences inthermal physiology.  not quantitative genetics or even really behavior,Tetrix subulata,pygmy grasshoppers,Insecta,tested thermal physiology,,not really relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Here, we compare body masses of mice from control and selected lines after 14 generations of selection. In both groups, beginning at weaning and then for 8 weeks, we housed half of the individuals with access to running wheels that were free to rotate and the other half with wheels that were locked to prevent rotation. Mice from selected lines were more active than controls at weaning (21 days) and across the experiment (total revolutions during last week: females 2.5-fold higher, males 2.1-fold higher). At weaning, mice from selected and control lines did not differ significantly in body mass, At 79 days of age, mice from selected lines weighed 13.6 % less than mice from control lines, whereas mice with access to free wheels weighed 4.5 % less than 'sedentary' individuals; both effects were statistically significant and additive.

Genetic correlations can be used to test the validity and generality of these functional relationships by indicating the lever of genetic integration and checking the conditions under which they are expressed. Phenotypic correlations indicate that there is a widespread trade-off between flight capability and early fecundity in insects. Different wing morphs (long and short wing) are thought to have a suite of reproductive and right capability traits. In a half-sib mating experiment, we estimated phenotypic relationships between two flight-capability-related characters (flight muscle condition, wing morph) and two components of early fecundity (number of eggs in the ovaries, number of eggs laid), as well as genetic correlations relating wing morph and both components of fecundity in the wing-dimorphic cricket, Gryllus firmus. The number of eggs in the ovaries and the number of eggs laid were negatively correlated phenotypically and genetically with wing length morph (i.e., long wings associated with low fecundity). Both fecundity characters differed between wing morphs, but only if flight muscle was present and not histolyzed. The phenotypic and genetic correlations between fecundity characters were not significant. This suggests that the phenotypic relationship between ovary development and eggs laid is complex, they are not genetically integrated, and they may evolve independently. However, both early fecundity characters are functionally and genetically integrated within the trade-off to a similar degree. Finally, the trade-off affects early fecundity of both wing morphs suggesting that the functional relationship depends on flight muscle size.",ovary development and eggs laid are not genetically integrated but they are integrated within tradeoff on wing and fecundity to a similar degree,Gryllus firmus,cricket,Insecta,half-sib mating experiment,half-sib,flight capability and early fecundity. eggs negatively correlated with wing length morph,maybe,,,x,,x,,,x,,,,,,,,,,not human

Selection   resulting from social interactions,153,1999," Social interactions often affect the fitness of interactants. Because of this, social selection has been described as a process distinct from other forms of natural selection. Social selection has been predicted to result in different evolutionary dynamics for interacting phenotypes, including rapid or extreme evolution and evolution of altruism. Despite the critical role that social selection plays in theories of social evolution, few studies have measured the force of social selection or the conditions under which this force changes. Here we present a model of social selection acting on interacting phenotypes that can be evaluated independently from the genetics of interacting phenotypes. Our model of social selection is analogous to covariance model of other forms of selection. We observe that an opportunity for social selection exists whenever individual fitness varies as a result of interactions with conspecifics. Social selection occurs, therefore, when variation in fitness due to interactions covaries with traits, resulting in a net force of selection acting on the interacting phenotypes. Thus, there must be a covariance between the phenotypes of the interactants for social selection to exist. This interacting phenotype covariance is important because it measures the degree to which a particular trait covaries with the selective environment provided by conspecifics. A variety of factors, including nonrandom interactions, behavioral modification during interactions, relatedness, and indirect genetic effects may contribute to the covariance of interacting phenotypes, which promotes social selection. The independent force of social selection (measured as a social selection gradient) can be partitioned empirically from the force of natural selection (measured by the natural selection gradient) using partial regression. This measure can be combined with genetic models of interacting phenotypes to provide insights into social evolution.",social selectio model is analagous to covariance model fo other forms of selection,,,,model,,interacting phenotypes that can be evaluated independently from the genotypes - byeond the scope of the chapter,no,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,x,,not human

In conjunction, we examined potential fitness consequences of cannibalism under different levels of food availability by measuring time of larval development and size at adult. Using a full-sib design, we split broods into food environments that differed by five-fold and measured rates of cannibalism by third instar larvae on first instar conspecifics. Surprisingly, there was significant genetic variation in the expression of cannibalism in response to increased prey levels. Some families exhibited a decrease in cannibalistic behaviour, some an increase, while some families did not alter their cannibalistic rate in response to different food levels. In the low food environment, there was a strong genetic basis for the expression of cannibalism with a heritability significantly different from zero. In the higher food environment, heritability was not significantly different from zero. However, evolvabilities for cannibalism were similarly high for both food level environments. Fitness consequences also depended on food levels. Larvae from the low food environments reduced their development time by approximately 1 day when they cannibalized an average of one first-instar conspecific larva.

Cannibalistic behaviour commonly increases in stressful conditions, such as when density is high or food is scarce, and cannibals often obtain a nutritional benefit. Might cannibalism also increase in a novel environment to which a population is poorly adapted physiologically? Moreover, might cannibalistic behaviour provide enough of a nutritional advantage in a nutritionally stressful environment to rescue individuals from its adverse effects and thus permit colonization and range expansion? Previous work has shown that oat flour is a particularly stressful environment for Tribolium castaneum. In the study reported here, egg cannibalism by two strains of T. castaneum was significantly enhanced in oat flour, and egg eating rescued larvae from the adverse demographic effects of this poor environment. Development time of the cannibals was accelerated almost to the level seen for individuals reared in the nutritionally superior environment (wheat plus brewer's yeast). Their survival and fecundity also increased relative to individuals reared in oat flour without the opportunity to cannibalize. A sib analysis revealed that for larvae reared in the presence of victim eggs, the extent of cannibalism was genetically variable, so that this trait could evolve, given a selective benefit exceeding its cost. These results suggest that colonization of a marginal new environment could be facilitated by enhanced rates of cannibalism.

Human 'predators' were asked to 'catch' (mouse-click) prey of different sizes, moving at different speeds across a computer screen. Using the simulation, a prey's chances of escaping predation depended on its speed (faster prey were more difficult to catch than slower prey of the same body size), but also on its size (larger prey were easier to catch than smaller prey at the same speed). Catching time, the time needed to catch a prey, also depended on both prey speed and prey size. Relative prey speed (body lengths/s or body surface/s) was a better predictor of catching time than was absolute prey speed (m/s).

Mixed model ANOVA detected no significant effects of genotype and genotype-environment interaction on colony fitness, whereas the fitness was higher on younger hosts. This suggests that no single clone exceeds other clones in fitness in all environments. While a significantly larger amount of genotypic variance was detected in body size and adult proportion, the soldier proportion exhibited less genotypic variance. This result suggests that the soldier proportion is intimately associated with fitness and is under strict stabilizing selection.

 J, HUMAN HEREDITY," Guo, SWAF Guo, SW", The behaviors of some heritability estimators in the complete absence of   genetic factors,49,1999," Heritability is an important concept in quantitative genetics and is widely used in human genetics. A high or even a moderate value of heritability estimate is usually taken as evidence for a genetic component for a quantitative trait. In this paper, the behaviors of some correlation-based heritability estimators are reexamined under the assumption of complete absence of any genetic factors. It turns out that when monozygotic (MZ) twins (or full sibs) are environmentally more similar than dizygotic twins (or half sibs), or when there is placement bias in MZ twins reared a part, those correlation-based heritability estimates can lead to nonnegligible or even high heritability values, even when genetic factors are completely absent. These alarming results suggest that extreme care should be exercised when using these heritability estimators.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

While genetic analyses have come to play a significant role in biological anthropology, there has been little use of modern methods for linkage mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). It is now feasible to design research studies to investigate the quantitative genetics of complex phenotypes that are of primary importance to traditional questions in biological anthropology. Complex traits such as functionally significant morphological features, physiological characteristics or aspects of behavior can be examined to estimate the influence of genetic variation on within-species phenotypic variation. In addition, new methods for mapping quantitative trait loci provide opportunities to identify the regions within chromosomes that contain the functional genes of interest. This review summarizes molecular genetic and statistical genetic approaches to QTL mapping, and presents examples of how this approach can expand the scope of anthropological genetics to include mapping and identifying individual genes that influence complex phenotypic traits relevant to fundamental questions in biological anthropology (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Firstly, a brief history of quality control in mass-reared insects is described. Next, the differentiation of many traits of wild and mass-reared melon flies, Bactrocera cucurbitae, in Okinawa is reviewed, and the factors which have caused variation in these traits are considered. As artificial selection pressures are thought to be more important than inbreeding depression and genetic drift in the mass-reared strain of the Okinawan melon fly, two artificial selection experiments were conducted to evaluate genetic variations and genetic correlations among life history and behavioral traits. These are divergent selections for age at reproduction and for developmental period. The genetic relationship among 5 traits, i.e. longevity, age at reproduction, developmental period, circadian period, and time of mating was clarified and discussed in relation to genetic changes of traits during the mass-rearing.

 J, ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR," Savalli, UM   Fox, CWAF Savalli, UM   Fox, CW", Genetic variation in paternal investment in a seed beetle,56,1998," Males of many species invest resources in their offspring. For paternal investment to evolve, it must exhibit heritable variation. Using a standard half-sibling quantitative genetic design, we investigated whether genetic variation in male ejaculate size, a trait that affects female fecundity and copulation duration, are present in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. Ejaculate size was estimated as the amount of weight lost by males during mating, Dams, but not sires, had significant effects on their sons' absolute ejaculate size (both replicates) and relative ejaculate size (proportion of body weight; one replicate only), explaining 21-25% of the variance in absolute ejaculate size and 8-16% of the variance in relative ejaculate size. These results suggest either a large maternal effect on ejaculate size or sex-linkage of loci that affect the variation in ejaculate size. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by sex-linkage (assuming no maternal effects) was 42 and 49% (ejaculate size) and 17 and 31% (relative ejaculate size) in the two replicates. These results indicate that male paternal investment can respond to selection, and that it may be able to do so especially rapidly because sex-linked traits have the potential to evolve much more quickly than autosomal traits. There were only weak negative correlations between ejaculate size and mating duration; contrary to what we predicted. There was additive genetic variation in female copulation duration, but not in male copulation duration, suggesting that copulation duration is under female control.

Because crickets were examined under optimal Conditions, these studies did not attempt to address how or whether fitness trade-offs change with the environment. In the present study, we allowed crickets ad libitum access to water, but restricted food intake to the minimum amount that would keep them alive for 20 days. On average, SW males called longer than LW males On 18 of 20 days in the stressed group, and 17 of 20 days in the control group. For both groups, SW males also attracted more females more often than did LW males. Although the absolute call durations decreased in the stressed group compared with the control group, the relative call durations remained approximately the same, as did the proportion of females moving towards the SW male. Cumulative call distributions showed that LW males called little after 10 days of adult life; the amount of time SW males spent calling seemed constant for the duration of the experiment.

This paper examines the relative role of intrinsic behavioral and physiological factors in host specialization of two species of leaf-feeding beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Ophraella notulata and Ophraella slobodkini are sister taxa that feed exclusively on the asteraceous plants Iva frutescens and Ambrosia artemisiifolia, respectively. Ambrosia is the ancestral host plant for this pair of beetles. I performed full-sib breeding experiments in both the laboratory and the field to assess mean responses of each species to both its native host and the host of its congener, genetic variation within each species for traits associated with using each host, and tradeoffs in performance across hosts. I reared each beetle species on each host plant and measured larval consumption, survival, development time and growth. I measured only survival and growth in the field. Genetic correlations were calculated to assess tradeoffs in performance across hosts. In the laboratory experiment, larval survival of O. slobodkini on I. frutescens was lower and development time longer than on A. artemisiifolia. Survival of O. notulata on A. artemisiifolia was marginally lower than on I.frutescens while development time did not differ. There was little genetic variation among families in host use traits for either species. None of the estimates of genetic correlations were negative. The results of the field experiment support the results of the laboratory experiment. I conclude that O. notulata, the species with the derived host association, retains considerable ability to utilize the ancestral host plant, while O. slobodkini, the species with the ancestral host association, does not show a similar ability to utilize the derived host. Tradeoffs in performance across hosts were not documented for either species of Ophraella.

 J, JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY," Roff, DAAF Roff, DA", The maintenance of phenotypic and genetic variation in threshold traits   by frequency-dependent selection,11,1998," Many traits are phenotypically dimorphic but determined by the action of many loci, the phenotype being a result of a threshold of sensitivity. Quantitative genetic analysis has shown that generally there is considerable additive genetic variation for the trait, the average heritability being 0.52. In numerous cases threshold traits have been shown, or are assumed, to be under frequency-dependent selection; examples include satellite-territorial behaviour, sex-determination, wing dimorphism and trophic dimorphism. In this paper I investigate the potential for frequency-dependent selection to maintain both phenotypic and additive genetic variation in threshold traits. The qualitative results are robust to the particular form of the frequency-dependent selection function. The equilibrium proportion is more or less independent of population size but the heritability increases with population size, typically approaching its maximal value at a population size of 5000, when the mutation rate is 10(-4). A tenfold decrease in the mutation rate requires an approximate doubling of the population size before an asymptotic value is approached. Thus frequency-dependent selection can account for both the existence of two morphs in a population and the observed levels of heritability. It is also shown, both via simulation and theory, that the quantitative genetic model and a simple phenotypic analysis predict the same equilibrium morph proportion.",potential for frequency dependent selection to maintain additive genetic variation in threshold traits. a model,,,,model of threshold traits,,worth revisiting for the theoretical framework side of the chapter,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

To evaluate this hypothesis, we assessed quantitative genetic variation in abdominal and sternopleural bristle numbers among homozygous isogenic third chromosomes sampled from nature and substituted into the Samarkand (Sam) inbred chromosome 1 and 2 background; among homozygous lines in which the wild-derived Dl-H gene region was introgressed into the Sam chromosome 3 background; and among Dl-H region introgression lines as heterozygotes against the Sam wild-type strain and derivatives of Sam into which mutant Dl and H alleles had been introgressed. Variation among the Dl-H region introgression lines accounted for 36% (8.3%) of the total chromosome 3 among line variance in abdominal (sternopleural) bristle number and for 53% of the chromosome 3 sex X line variance in abdominal bristle number. Naturally occurring alleles in the Dl-H region failed to complement a Dl mutant allele for female abdominal bristle number and sternopleural bristle number in both sexes, and an H mutant allele for both bristle traits in males and females.

However, averages of the number of eggs laid by receptive and reluctant females within 21 days were almost same. The proportion of fertilized eggs for receptive females at 15-21 days after copulation was significantly lower than that for reluctant females. Spermatozoa transferred from a male to a female's spermatheca were detected 5 min after copulation and then increased continuously to about 500 with the first hour. When copulation durations were manipulated artificially, the shorter the copulation period (=females had less sperm in their spermathecae), the higher the remating rate became.

Imprinting is presumed to be either maternal (i.e., the maternally derived gene is inactivated) or paternal. Females are assumed to be either completely monogamous or always bigamous, so that we may see any effect of multiple paternity. In contrast to previous verbal and quantitative genetic models, we find that genetic conflicts need not lead to paternal imprinting of growth inhibitors and maternal imprinting of growth enhancers. Indeed, in some of our models-those with strict monogamy-the dynamics of maternal and paternal imprinting are identical. Multiple paternity is not necessary for the evolution of imprinting, and in our models of maternal imprinting, multiple paternity has no effect at all. Nevertheless, multiple paternity favors the evolution of paternal imprinting of growth inhibitors and hinders that of growth enhancers. Hence, any degree of multiple paternity means that growth inhibitors are more likely to be paternally imprinted, and growth enhancers maternally so. In all of our models, stable polymorphism of imprinting status is possible and mean fitness can decrease over time.

Mechanical consideration of wishboning at the symphysis indicates exponentially higher stresses along the lingual surface with increasing symphyseal curvature. Lengthening the anteroposterior width of the symphysis acts to resist these higher loads. Interspecific adult cercopithecine allometries show that both symphyseal curvature and symphyseal width exhibit positive allometry relative to body mass. The experimental and allometric data support an hypothesis that the cercopithecine mandibular symphysis is designed to maintain functional equivalence-in this case dynamic strain similarity-in wishboning stress and strain magnitudes across adult cercopithecines.   We test the hypothesis that functional equivalence during masticatory wishboning is maintained throughout ontogeny by calculating-relative stress estimates from morphometric dimensions of the mandibular symphysis in two cercopithecine primates, Macaca fascicularis and M. nemestrina. Results indicate no significant differences in relative stress estimates among the two macaque ontogenies and an interspecific sample of adult papionin primates. Further, relative stress estimates do not change significantly throughout ontogeny in either species. These results offer the first evidence for the maintenance of functional equivalence in stress and strain levels during postnatal growth in a habitually loaded cranial structure.   Scaling analyses demonstrate significant slope differences for both symphyseal curvature and width between the ontogenetic and interspecific samples. The distinct interspecific cercopithecine slopes are realized by a series of ontogenetic transpositions in both symphyseal curvature and width. Throughout papionin ontogeny, symphyseal curvature increases with less negative allometry, while symphysis width increases with less positive allometry versus the interspecific pattern. As symphyseal curvature and width are inversely proportional to one another in estimating relative stresses, functionally equivalent stress levels are maintained both ontogenetically and interspecifically, because the relatively slower rate of allometric increase in symphyseal curvature during growth is compensated for by a slower rate of allometric increase in symphyseal width. These results indicate the primacy of maintaining functional equivalence during growth and the need for ontogenetic data in understanding the evolutionary processes that affect form-function relations as well as the interspecific patterning of adult form across a clade.

When 25 RI strains are used, the estimated equivalent number of F-2 mice yielding the same power to detect QTLs varies inversely as a function of the heritability of the trait in the RI population (h(RI)(2)). For example, testing 25 strains with n = 10 per strain is approximately equivalent to 160 F-2 mice when h(RI)(2) = 0.2, but only 55 when h(RI)(2) = 0.6. While increasing n is always beneficial, the gain in power as n increases is greatest when h(RI)(2) is low and is much diminished at high h(RI)(2) values. Thus, when h(RI)(2) is high, there is little advantage of large n, even when n approaches infinity. A cost analysis suggested that RI populations are more cost-effective than conventional selectively genotyped F-2 populations at h(RI)(2) values likely to be seen in behavioral studies. However, with DNA pooling, this advantage is greatly reduced and may be reversed depending on the values of h(RI)(2) and n.","recombinant inbred lines might be more cost effective, but it depends ont he heritability of the trait in the RI populations - and with DNA technology changing that may not be true anymore",Mus musculus,mouse,Mammalia,examine sample size on additive QTL mapping efficienccy and make comparisons with F2 and backcross populations,"QTL mapping, F2 backcross",a bit outdated,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

At the end of the experiment, mice from both wheel-access groups were significantly lighter in body mass than mice from sedentary groups. Within the wheel-access group, a statistically significant, negative relationship existed between activity and final body mass. In measurements of maximum oxygen consumption during forced treadmill exercise ((V) over dot O-2max), mice with wheel access were significantly more cooperative than sedentary mice; however, trial quality was not a significant predictor of individual variation in (V) over dot O-2max.

A 12% difference in (V) over dot O-2max existed between wheel-access selected mice, which had the highest mass-corrected (V) over dot O-2max and sedentary control mice, which had the lowest.

 J, BIOESSAYS," Plomin, R   Craig, IAF Plomin, R   Craig, I", Human behavioural genetics of cognitive abilities and disabilities,19,1997," Although neither the genome nor the environment can be manipulated in research on human behaviour, some of the new tools of molecular genetics can be brought to bear on human behavioural disorders (e.g. cognitive disabilities) and quantitative traits (e.g. cognitive abilities). The inability to manipulate the human genome experimentally has had the positive effect of focusing attention on naturally occuring genetic variation responsible for behavioural differences among individuals in all their complex multifactorial splendour. Genes in such complex multiple-gene systems are called quantitative trait loci (QTLs), which merge the two worlds of genetic research, quantitative genetics and molecular genetics. Although most genetic research on complex human behaviour has focused on severe mental disorders, cognitive abilities and disabilities may be even more immediately relevant to neuroscience. For example, verbal ability and spatial ability are two of the most heritable cognitive abilities, and reading disability is the first behavioural disability for which replicated QTL linkage has been found. The purpose of this essay is to provide an overview of the genetics of cognitive abilities and disabilities as an example of the impending merger of quantitative genetics and molecular genetics in QTL analysis of complex traits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Using a half-sib breeding design, we screened for genetic variation in oviposition preference for two hosts within both populations, and examined whether this variation is correlated with weevil pre-adult (egg-to-adult viability and egg-to-adult developmental time) and adult (female fecundity and longevity) fitness components on these two hosts. Significant differences between the Phaseolus and Cicer population were detected in viability, developmental time and oviposition preference, but not in female fecundity and longevity. The absence of a significant population x host interaction in all traits, except for developmental time in males, indicates that the Cicer population has not attained the status of 'host race'. The estimated narrow-sense heritabilities within population within host plant were in the low-to-moderate level (range: 1%-79%), with an overall average of about 24%. Within the population maintained on the chickpeas we detected significant genetic correlations between female developmental time on chickpea seeds and preference for chickpeas. In the population maintained on the primary host of this weevil species (the 'Phaseolus' population) we found no significant preference/performance genetic correlations. Data are also presented on the genetic correlations of preference and performance across host seeds within both populations.

In the cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea, male-male competition and female male choice are mediated by a multicomponent male-produced sex pheromone. In this study, I examine variation in this pheromone. First I measure differences among males in both individual pheromone compounds and the overall composition of the pheromone. Principal component analysis is used to quantify and describe pheromone composition. Next, I explore some of the causes and consequences of this variation by examining the pheromone of males with different social experiences. Compared to subordinate males, dominant males have significantly less variable quantities of the individual pheromone compounds and are significantly less variable in the composition of their pheromone. Because of an association between status and mating success, male-male competition can result in stabilizing sexual selection on the sex pheromone. Finally, I test the hypothesis that the pheromone compounds evolve in a manner consistent with their function. As predicted for morphologically integrated characters, the patterns of phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations among my measures of pheromone compounds and composition match functional patterns suggested by this study and the developmental patterns demonstrated in my previous studies. Based on these studies of the N. cinerea sex pheromone, I argue that stabilizing sexual selection shapes the: evolution of pheromonal communication involved in social interactions among male N. cinerea. Further, I argue that coordinated evolution of social signals may be possible due to the morphological integration of their multiple compounds.",stabilizing sexual selection shapes the evolution of pheromonal communication,Nauphoeta cinerea,cockroach,Insecta,compare males of different social experiences,full-sib,"as predicted for morphologically integrated characters, the patterns of phenotypic genetic and environmental corelations among measures match functional patterns. good example of quantitative genetics of signaling trais paired with behavioral associations",maybe,,x,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, EVOLUTION," Van Buskirk, J   McCollum, SA   Werner, EEAF Van Buskirk, J   McCollum, SA   Werner, EE", Natural selection for environmentally induced phenotypes in tadpoles,51,1997," Models suggest that phenotypic plasticity is maintained in situations where the optimal phenotype differs through time or space, so that selection acts in different directions in different environments. Some empirical work supports the general premise of this prediction because phenotypes induced by a particular environment sometimes perform better than other phenotypes when tested in that environment. We have extended these results by estimating the targets of selection in Pseudacris triseriata tadpoles in environments without predators and with larval Anax dragonflies. Tadpoles displayed significant behavioral and morphological plasticity when reared in the presence and absence of nonlethal dragonflies for 32 days in cattle tanks. We measured selection in the absence of free predators by regressing growth and survival in the tanks against activity and several measures of tail and body shape. We measured selection in the presence of predators by exposing groups of 10 tadpoles to Anax in overnight predation trials and regressing the average phenotype of survivors against the number of tadpoles killed. Selection in the two environments acted in opposite directions on both tail and body shape, although the affected fitness components were different. In the presence of Anax, tadpoles with shallow and narrow body, deep tail fin, and wide tail muscle survived best. In the absence of free predators, tadpoles with narrow tail muscle grew significantly faster, and those with shallow tail fin and deep body grew somewhat faster. Activity was unrelated to survival or growth in either environment. Developmental plasticity in tail shape closely paralleled selection, because tail fin depth increased after long-term exposure to Anax and tail muscle width tended to increase. In contrast, there was no plasticity in body shape in spite of strong selection for decreasing body depth. Thus, when confronted with a dragonfly predator, P. triseriata tadpoles adjusted their tail shape (but not body shape) almost exactly in the direction of selection imposed by Anax. These results suggest that phenotypic plasticity in some morphological traits, such as tail depth and tail muscle width, has evolved under intermittent selection by dragonflies. Other traits that undergo selection by dragonflies, such as body morphology, appear developmentally rigid, perhaps because of historically strong opposing selection in nature or other constraints.",test to see if phenotypic plasticity is maintained when optimal phenotype differs through time and space,Pseudacris triseriata,western chorus frog,Amphibia,rear tadpoles in presence and absence of predators. measured selection by regressing average phenotyp eo fsurvivors against those killed,selection experiment,displayed significant behavioral and morphological plasticity. selection in two environments acted in opposite direction on tail and body shape but not behavior. ,probably not,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,x,,,,not human

Characterization of egg-laying behavior revealed that B. hebetor commits ovicide during the host examination phase of oviposition. The temporal costs of ovicide were found to be relatively small for females that experienced low rates of host encounter, whereas the costs of ovicide increased for females that experienced a high rate of host encounter. Individual wasps committed ovicide on conspecifically parasitized hosts more frequently than on self-parasitized hosts. Manipulation experiments suggested that B. hebetor females learn about their environment while foraging and commit ovicide on the basis of the travel time between successive hosts.

 J, EVOLUTION," Moore, AJ   Brodie, ED   Wolf, JBAF Moore, AJ   Brodie, ED   Wolf, JB", Interacting phenotypes and the evolutionary process .1. Direct and   indirect genetic effects of social interactions,51,1997," Interacting phenotypes are traits whose expression is affected by interactions with conspecifics. Commonly-studied interacting phenotypes include aggression, courtship, and communication. More extreme examples of interacting phenotypes - traits that exist exclusively as a product of interactions-include social dominance, intraspecific competitive ability, and mating systems. We adopt a quantitative genetic approach to assess genetic influences on interacting phenotypes. We partition genetic and environmental effects so that traits in conspecifics that influence the expression of interacting phenotypes are a component of the environment. When the trait having the effect is heritable, the environmental influence arising from the interaction has a genetic basis and can be incorporated as an indirect genetic effect. However, because it has a genetic basis, this environmental component can evolve. Therefore, to consider the evolution of interacting phenotypes we simultaneously consider changes in the direct genetic contributions to a trait (as a standard quantitative genetic approach would evaluate) as well as changes in the environmental (indirect genetic) contribution to the phenotype. We then explore the ramifications of this model of inheritance on the evolution of interacting phenotypes. The relative rate of evolution in interacting phenotypes can be quite different from that predicted by a standard quantitative genetic analysis. Phenotypic evolution is greatly enhanced or inhibited depending on the nature of the direct and indirect genetic effects. Further, unlike most models of phenotypic evolution, a lack of variation in direct genetic effects does not preclude evolution if there is genetic variance in the indirect genetic contributions. The available empirical evidence regarding the evolution of behavior expressed in interactions, although limited, supports the predictions of our model.",interacting phenotypes are traits whose expression is affected by interactions with conspecifics (IGE),,,,statistical model,,quantiative genetic approach to assess genetic influences on interacting henotypes. consider changes in direct genetic contributions and indirect genetic contributions - relative rate of evolution can be quite different from taht predited by a standard quantitative genetic analysis,skim,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,x,,not human

Recent developments in quantitative trait locus (QTL) methodology were promptly applied to the task of individuating polygenes affecting alcohol-related attributes in animal models and a body of reliable data is gradually coming into focus as a result of replication and convergence of evidence from a variety of methods. A key issue in QTL research is the need to distinguish true positive results from the false positive results that are inherent in analytical procedures requiring large numbers of significance tests. One school of thought holds that stringent significance levels should be imposed;(1,2) another suggests more modest criteria for QTL nomination, with subsequent confirmation trials with independent samples.(3-5) Recombinant inbred strains(6,7) and various types of intercrosses(8,9) have been used in correlational designs, both for nomination and confirmation studies.

 J, THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY," Dawson, KJAF Dawson, KJ", Linkage disequilibrium and the infinitesimal limit,52,1997," Under the classical Fisher-Bulmer infinitesimal model of quantitative genetics, the within family distribution for an additive trait with no environmental component is Gaussian with mean at the mid-parent value and a variance which is the same for all families. When an additive trait is determined by unlinked loci, the Fisher-Bulmer model can arise in the limit as the number of loci contributing to variation in the trait increases. However, a counterexample is presented where the Fisher-Bulmer model fails to arise in the infinite locus limit because there is too much linkage disequilibrium. An example is also presented where a degenerate form of the Fisher-Bulmer model arises.   Under what conditions does the Fisher-Bulmer model arise in the infinite locus limit? It follows from the central limit theorem that the within-family distribution is Gaussian. But, under what conditions is the within-family distribution the same for almost all families in the population?   An alternative population genetic derivation of the Fisher-Bulmer model is presented for a population at linkage equilibrium. This approach is then extended to allow many patterns of linkage disequilibrium. Diallelic models are used to illustrate the type of linkage disequilibrium allowed.   The results on the limiting behaviour of population genetic models with many unlinked loci can be regarded as special cases of a more general limiting property of sequences of random variables. A possible application of this more general result to models of cultural inheritance is suggested.

Both traits were highly heritable (H-2 = 0.82, 0.87, respectively). Several strains were found to be significantly resistant to halothane when compared with the wild-type strain N2. A major locus or loci mapping to the middle of chromosome V accounted for more than 40% of the phenotypic variance for both traits, Five weaker loci, four of which interact, explained most of the remaining variance, None of the halothane-sensitivity quantitative trait loci significantly affected behavior in the absence of halothane or halothane's potency for C. elegans immobilization, which requires 5-fold higher drug concentrations, Thus, the quantitative trait loci are unlikely to result from differences in halothane-independent (native) behavior or differences in halothane metabolism or permeability.

To what extent do disorders differ quantitatively or qualitatively from variation in the normal range? Genetic research on the normal and the abnormal differs in terms of concepts, methods, statistics, and target audiences. An approach, referred to as ''DF'' analysis, provides a framework for integrating these two worlds of genetic analysis. We applied traditional correlational analyses as well as DF (DeFries & Fulker, 1985) analyses to mother and father ratings of adjustment of adolescent siblings in a 3-year longitudinal twin and step-family study. At wave 1, the sample included 720 sibling pairs (average age of 12.9 years for the younger sibling and 14.5 years for the older siblings) and, in wave 2, 395 pairs still living at home. Both correlational analyses of the entire sample and DF analyses of selected extremes suggested moderate genetic influence and modest shared environmental influence for internalizing and externalizing behavior problems.

We investigate the genetic and physiological basis of the coevolution of this suite of traits using laboratory lines of the wing dimorphic cricket, Gryllus firmus, selected for increasing and decreasing incidence of macroptery. Selection on wing morphology has produced strong direct responses in proportion macropterous as well as correlated (indirect) responses in wing muscle histolysis, flight propensity and fecundity. We investigate the hypothesis that these responses have been mediated by changes in the metabolism of juvenile hormone (JH) during the final nymphal stadium (the critical period for wing morph determination). Previous studies of Gryllus sp. have established that JH titre in this period is determined primarily by the activity of the degradative enzyme, juvenile hormone esterase (JHE). Assays of JHE activity in the final nymphal stadium of the replicated control and selected lines demonstrate highly significant differences in both mean activity and the probability of macroptery for a given level of activity (i.e., the threshold activity required to induce wing formation). These correlated responses in JH metabolism support the general hypothesis that the correlations among traits determining migratory tendency result at least in part from the common influence of JH during the final nymphal stadium.

I examined these populations for local adaptive responses in terms of oviposition behavior, growth, and chemical defense, on both P. lanceolata and K. elatine. In addition, I examined the genetic architecture underlying these traits using a full-sib quantitative genetic analysis. I found that a significant majority of females prefer the host plant species found at their collection sites in oviposition tests, but that there is no evidence that they are locally adapted in growth performance, as measured by fifth-instar and pupal weights and development times. Neither are there correlations between oviposition preferences of females and the growth performance or levels of chemical defense of their offspring. The two populations studied do, however, show specialization in terms of the levels of chemical. defense they sequester from their host plants. I argue that these results indicate that natural enemies are the normal barriers to host range expansion in this oligophagous herbivore because a breakdown in those barriers results in genetic changes that enhance resistance to predation. This is despite the fact that adaptive responses in physiology are unlikely to be limited by a lack of genetic variability; the genetic architecture among traits would be conducive to specialization in growth performance; and there are costs to chemical defense in this species. All these conditions would tend to argue that J. coenia harbors considerable potential for coevolutionary interactions with its chemically defended hosts, but this potential is not realized, probably because natural selection on diet breadth by natural enemies is much stronger than selection from host plants in this system.","novel host plant and typical host plant, examine oviposition behavior",Junonia coenia,buckeye butterfly,Insecta,full-sib quantitative genetic analysis,full-sib,"most females prefer host plant found at their collection sites, but this doesn't appear to be local adaptation.

Results indicated that censoring may be quite influential for these kinds of comparisons.

Clones that utilized shallow water at night were genetically smaller at maturity and lower fecundity under standard laboratory conditions than the deep-water clones. The magnitude of this clonal habitat specialization varied among lakes: populations displaying broad use of depth habitats contained greater genetic variance than populations with more constrained habitat use. These results are consistent with known differences in selective factors in different depth habitats and suggest that substantial clonal specialization can occur within single populations.

 J, GENETICA," Brown, RPAF Brown, RP", Testing for heterogeneity among phenotypic correlations: a comparison of   methods using Monte Carlo simulations,101,1997," Heterogeneous phenotypic correlations may be suggestive of underlying changes in genetic covariance among life-history, morphology, and behavioural traits, and their detection is therefore relevant to many biological studies. Two new statistical tests are proposed and their performances compared with existing methods. Of all tests considered, the existing approximate test of homogeneity of product-moment correlations provides the greatest power to detect heterogeneous correlations, when based on Hotelling's z*-transformation. The use of this transformation and test is recommended under conditions of bivariate normality. A new distribution-free randomisation test of homogeneity of Spearman's rank correlations is described and recommended for use when the bivariate samples are taken from populations with non-normal or unknown distributions. An alternative randomisation test of homogeneity of product-moment correlations is shown to be a useful compromise between the approximate tests and the randomisation tests on Spearman's rank correlations: it is not as sensitive to departures from normality as the approximate tests, but has greater power than the rank correlation test. An example is provided that shows how choice of test will have a considerable influence on the conclusions of a particular study.",not useful,,,,statistical tests,,phenotypic correlations statistical approaches - no useful,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, INTELLIGENCE," Rowe, DCAF Rowe, DC", A place at the policy table? Behavior genetics and estimates of family   environmental effects on IQ,24,1997," The knowledge generated in behavior genetic studies is not often made a part of social policy deliberations. The argument of this article is that behavior genetics belongs at the social policy table. Perhaps ironically, behavior genetics is one of the best methods for understanding environmental influences. Behavior genetic studies can reveal which traits are most influenced by shared environment and, thus, which are most malleable through changes in shared environments. The current consensus of behavior genetic studies is that IQ is not a particularly malleable trait, especially after childhood. Furthermore, for working- to middle-class families, the shared environmental effects on IQ in childhood seem to be temporary rather than lasting. Behavior genetics also can estimate genetic and family environmental components of racial differences in IQ because quantitative genetic models now permit the simultaneous analysis of group means and individual variation. Although not as directly relevant to policy as targeted research on specific policy options, behavior genetics clearly deserves representation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

One hundred sixty-five field estimates of narrow sense heritabilities derived from the literature are compared with 189 estimates from laboratory studies on wild, outbred animal populations derived from the data set of Mousseau and Roff. The results indicate that 84% of field heritabilities are significantly different from zero and that for morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits there are no significant differences between laboratory and field estimates of heritability. Unexpectedly, mean heritabilities for morphological and life-history traits are actually higher in the field than in the lab. Twenty-two cases were found for which both laboratory and natural heritabilities had been estimated on the same traits. For this subset of the data, laboratory heritabilities tended to be higher than field estimates, but the difference was not significant. Also, the correlation between lab and field estimates was high (r = 0.6, P < 0.001), and the regression slope did not differ significantly from one. The major implications of this study are that laboratory estimates of heritability should generally provide reasonable estimations of both the magnitude and the significance of heritabilities in nature.",mean heritabilities were higher int he field than the lab,,,,meta analysis,,not necessarily useful,probably not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Winkles From different habitats have different morphologies and behaviours, which are usually argued to reflect adaptations. Whether the different forms are caused by genetic differentiation or due to phenotypic plasticity is, however, less discussed. Our aim was to document morphological and behavioural differences among one exposed rock population, one sheltered boulder population, and one mud flat population, and we reared offspring in a common laboratory environment to see if the differences persisted.   We used principal component analysis (PCA), based on 19 measurements, to compare size and shape differences. We also used PCA and linear regression to study allometry and compare growth trajectories. Behavioural differences were studied in three laboratory trials.   Littorina saxatilis From the rock were relatively small, had small aperture lips, thin shells, blunt spires, and wide columellae. They preferred to stay in cracks and to be above the water surface, and they quickly emerged out of their shells after disturbance. L. saxatilis from the boulder shore were relatively large, had large lips, thick shells, pointed spires, and narrow columellae. They preferred open surfaces, submergence, and after disturbance they slowly emerged out of the shell. L. saxatilis from the mud flat were relatively small, had small lips, thin shells, pointed spires, and narrow columellae and most behaved similarly to the boulder shore snails. Although less pronounced, most of these morphological and behavioural differences persisted in the snails that we reared in the common environment. This indicates some genetic differentiation. All groups grew allometrically, and most groups differed in growth trajectories. Despite similar ages, the reared females were generally larger than the real ed males, indicating higher growth rate in females. Sexual maturation seemed to be reached at a certain size rather than at a certain age. Theories predict genetic differentiation in intertidal snail species with low dispersal, but some investigations show results that contradict the theories, while others agree with them. Our study confirms the prediction that L. saxatilis should be genetically differentiated.",different growth trajectories in common environment - not quantitative genetics,Littorina saxatilis,snail,Gastropoda,common laboratory experiement,,find evidence for genetic differentiation using common garden experiment - not quantitative genetics,probably not,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,not human

Significant genetic variation among chromosome lines was detected. Heritability estimates for olfactory response, however, were low, as is typical for traits under natural selection. Furthermore, the loci affecting naturally occurring variation in olfactory response to benzaldehyde were not the same in males and females, since the genetic correlation between the sexes was low and not significantly different from zero for the chromosome 3 lines. Competitive fitness, viability and fertility of the chromosome 3 lines were estimated using the balancer equilibrium technique. Genetic correlations between fitness and odor-guided behavior were not significantly different from zero, suggesting the number of loci causing variation in olfactory response is small relative to the number of loci causing variation in fitness. Since different genes affect variation in olfactory response in males and females, genetic variation for olfactory response could be maintained by genotype X sex environment interaction. This unusual genetic architecture implies that divergent evolutionary trajectories for olfactory behavior may occur in males and females.","genetic correlation between sexes was low, and males and females showed different responses",Drosophila melanogaster,fruit fly,Insecta,recombinant inbred lines,"inbred lines backcross F3, F4",loci causing variation in olfactory response is small relative to the number of loci causing fitness variation - olfactory response could be maintained by genotype x sex x environment interaction,probably not,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,x,not human

Different degrees of morphological and behavioural change were induced using two prey items commonly found in the diet of this species, allowing us to estimate the relative importance of each type of plasticity. The purpose of the experiment was twofold. First, earlier work had suggested that diet variability might be an important factor in the evolution of tropic morphological plasticity in sticklebacks. The present results extend this work by revealing the adaptive significance of morphological plasticity. The current experiment also qualitatively assessed the compatibility of the time scale of morphological change with that of the natural resource variability experienced by this species. The results indicate that diet-induced plasticity improves foraging efficiency continuously for up to 72 days of prey exposure. This is probably due in part to plasticity of the external trophic morphology but our results also suggest a complex interplay between morphology and behaviour. The time scale appears to be matched to that of natural diet variability although it is possible that some traits exhibit non-labile plasticity. Our discussion highlights the important distinction between conditions favouring the evolution of labile versus non-labile plasticity. The second objective of the experiment was to determine the relative importance of morphological and behavioural plasticity. Few studies have attempted to quantify the adaptive significance of morphological plasticity and no study to our knowledge has separated the effects of morphological and behavioural plasticity. Our experiment reveals that both behavioural and morphological plasticity are important and it also suggests a dichotomy between the two: behavioural plasticity predominately affects searching efficiency whereas morphological plasticity predominately affects handling efficiency.",not quantitative genetics,Gasterosteus aculeatus,three-spined stickleback,Actinopterygii,experiment to assess change in foraging efficiency resulting from diet induced morphological and behavioral plasticity,,diet induced plasticity improves foraging efficiency continuously for up to 72 days of prey exposure. both behavioral and morphological plasticity are important,probably not,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,x,,,,not human

 J, EVOLUTION," Roff, DAAF Roff, DA", The evolution of genetic correlations: An analysis of patterns,50,1996," The genetic correlation is a central parameter of quantitative genetics, providing a measure of the rate at which traits respond to indirect selection (i.e., selection that does not act upon the traits under study, but some other trait with which they have genes in common). In this paper, I review the pattern of variation among four combinations of traits: life history x life history (L x L), morphological x morphological (M x M), life history x morphological (L x M), and behavioral x behavioral (B x B). A few other combinations were investigated, but insufficient data were obtained for separate analysis. A total of 1798 correlations, distributed over 51 different animal and plant species, were analyzed. The analysis was conducted at two levels: first by dividing the data set solely by trait combination, and second by blocking the data by trait combination and species. Because selection will tend to fix alleles that show positive correlations with fitness traits faster than those that are negative and because the latter are expected to arise more frequently by mutation, correlations between life-history traits are predicted to be more often negative than those between morphological traits. This prediction was supported, with the ranking in decreasing proportion of negative correlations being: L x L > L x M > B x B > M x M. The mean magnitude of the genetic correlation shows little variation among morphological and life-history combinations, and the distribution of values is remarkably flat. However, the estimated standard errors and the coefficient of variation (SE/r(G)) are large, making it difficult to separate biological factors influencing the pattern of dispersion from experimental error. Analysis of the phenotypic and genetic correlations suggest that for the combinations M x M and L x M, but not L x L or B x B, the phenotypic correlation is an adequate estimate of the genetic correlation.",not behavior,,,,,,not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

A negative genetic correlation would qualify as an evolutionary ''constraint,'' because both aspects of locomotor performance are generally expected to be under positive directional selection in wild populations. We also tested whether speed or endurance showed any genetic correlation with body mass. For all traits, residuals from multiple regression equations were computed to remove effects of possible confounding variables such as age at testing, measurement block, observer, and sex. Estimates of quantitative genetic parameters were then obtained using Shaw's (1987) restricted maximum-likelihood programs, modified to account for our breeding design, which incorporated cross-fostering. Both speed and endurance were measured on two consecutive trial days, and both were repeatable. We initially analyzed performances on each trial day and the maximal value. For endurance, the three estimates of narrow-sense heritabilities ranged from 0.17 to 0.33 (full ADCE model), and some were statistically significantly different from zero using likelihood ratio tests. The heritability estimate for sprint speed measured on trial day I was 0.17, but negative for all other measures. Moreover, the additive genetic covariance between speeds measured on the two days was near zero, indicating that the two measures are to some extent different traits. The additive genetic covariance between speed on trial day 1 and any of the four measures of endurance was negative, large, and always statistically significant. None of the measures of speed or endurance was significantly genetically correlated with body mass. Thus, we predict that artificial selection for increased locomotor speed in these mice would result in a decrease in endurance, but no change in body mass. Such experiments could lead to a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms leading to trade-offs in aspects of locomotor abilities.",locomotr speed and endurance - is there a constraint?,Mus doemsticus,house mouse,Mammalia,REML analysis of cross-fostering breeding design,cross-foster,strong negative correlation between speed and endurance - likely a constraint,probably not,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,not human

These vocalizations were individually recorded in 1-day-old pups from seven inbred strains of laboratory mice, at two temperatures (23 +/- 0.5 and 15 +/- 0.5 degrees C). The numbers of clicks and whistles were counted under these two conditions. Moreover, the length and frequencies at the beginning, apex, and end of the whistles were measured during the 15 degrees C condition. Correlations, including several components-additivity, epistasis (between homozygous loci), and maternal environment--were calculated between the characteristics of the whistles during the 15 degrees C condition. Clicks and whistles were also counted from 1 to 8 days of age during the 15 degrees C: condition. The numbers of clicks and whistles were age dependent, with a decrease from day 1 to day 8 for the clicks and a consistent production of whistles. A quantitative genetic analysis was also performed on the 1-day-old pups from the Mendelian generations produced by the inbred strains most contrasting for the number of whistles produced in the cold condition: NZB/B1NJ and CBA/H. The heterozygous genotype of the mother induced an increment of the number of whistles. Moreover, a significant part of the additive variance was suspected from the first design, and found with the second one, for this variable. Quantitative genetic analysis showed significant dominance and epistasis between homozygous loci and homozygous and heterozygous loci. This points to multigenic correlates for the number of whistles in this population. The significant additive values for all the variables recorded during the 15 +/- 0.5 degrees C condition and for the number of whistles produced during the 23 +/- 0.5 degrees C condition are compatible with an effect that indicates neither directional nor stabilizing selection.

The reciprocal F-1 crosses showed significant heterosis for nest-building behavior compared to the contemporaneous generations of the parental lines. This pattern of heterosis in all three crosses is consistent with the finding that nest-building behavior in each of the four replicate lines had a different genetic basis, in spite of the phenotypic similarity between the two replicate lines in the high and low direction of nesting. This heterosis effect and the larger number of young weaned in all three crosses compared to their respective contemporaneous generation of the parental lines also support earlier findings that larger nests are closely related to fitness.","significant heterosis for nest=building behavior, evidence that nest building had a different genetic basis in each of the four replicate lines",Mus doemsticus,house mouse,Mammalia,reciprocl F1 crosses of replicate lines,reciprocal F1 cross of inbred lines,example of heterosis/hybrid vigor in abehavior,skim,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

The relative order of magnitude of the values agrees with that of other data: morphological>behavioural>life-history characters. Repeated measures of copula duration for each male revealed a general increase in copula duration with Julian date or age. The individual pattern of this change in copula duration (here termed 'flexibility'), an expression of phenotypic plasticity, was itself marginally heritable (h(2)=0.19, P=0.065). Significant positive phenotypic and genetic covariance was evident only between flexibility of copula duration and body size. All other correlations were not different from zero, including those between development time and body size and between copula duration and body size. It is suggested that in S stercoraria populations there is some averaging selection towards a mean optimal copula duration which can guide an individual's behaviour in a variety of environments. At the same time, there is selection for phenotypic plasticity which allows individuals to adapt their behaviour to their immediate environment.

 J, BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND EVOLUTION," Aboitiz, FAF Aboitiz, F", Does bigger mean better? Evolutionary determinants of brain size and   structure,47,1996," Current perspectives on brain evolution relate brain size variability to two main parameters: a scaling factor that corresponds to overall body size and an ecological factor associated with behavioral capacity. I suggest in this paper that in evolution body weight and ecological conditions have different effects on brain structure, resulting in distinct differences in neural architecture, even if both factors may produce brain size increases. There are two postulated modalities of brain growth, one passive that lags behind increases in body size, and one active that relates to selection of specific behavioral abilities and hence increased processing capacity. These two modes of growth differ in three main aspects: (i) cellular and connectional rearrangements are modest in passive brain growth while they are conspicuous in active growth, corresponding to increases in processing capacity; (ii) passive brain growth follows a rather conservative allometric rule between brain components, while active growth usually affects only a few brain parts, thereby producing much steeper allometric relations between these parts and sometimes also in brain/body relations; and (iii) passive growth may either affect early periods of ontogenic brain development or produce a generalized increase in cell proliferation in later periods. On the other hand, active growth is restricted to relatively late developmental periods, Finally, an evolutionary scenario for the active mode is proposed where phylogenetic selection of an increased number of cells in particular br ain regions occurs in order to facilitate neural reorganization and to increase the specificity of connections, This view emphasizes the role of connectional modifications in increasing brain capacity and contrasts with current ideas of a unitary process of phylogenetic brain growth, where a larger brain size per se produces better processing capacity, regardless of the causal factor behind it.",not behavior,,,,,,brain growth,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY," Carriere, Y   Roitberg, BDAF Carriere, Y   Roitberg, BD", Optimality modelling and quantitative genetics as alternatives to study   the evolution of foraging behaviours in insect herbivores.,10,1996," Although the evolution of large-scale dispersal has received considerable attention, we know very little about how natural selection influences foraging behaviours in herbivorous insects. Host-selection behaviours and within-habitat movements jointly determine foraging behaviours, since host selection affects the allocation of time spent on a particular host versus moving between these hosts. However, host selection is generally a labile trait, whose expression is influenced by the physiological state of the forager and hence, by characteristics of the habitat. We discuss how the quantitative genetic concepts can be used to study the evolution of such labile behaviours. Since host responses depend on the physiological state of the forager, it is argued that the state of the forager must be explicitly considered when estimating the additive genetic basis of host-selection behaviours. The lability of foraging behaviours increases the difficulty of measuring the fitness consequence of variation in the foraging phenotype in specific habitats, Therefore, it may be difficult to rely exclusively on quantitative genetic methods to test hypotheses about adaptive change in foraging behaviours across different habitats. We provide a novel approach based on optimality modelling to calculate the fitness consequence of variation in the foraging phenotype across different habitats. This method, in conjunction with quantitative genetics, can be used to test hypotheses concerning the evolution of foraging behaviours.","host selection is a labile trait,, and can be studied by quantitative genetic concepts",,,,review/method,,provide  novel approach based on optimality modeling to calculate fitness consequence of variation in forging phenotype across differet habitts,probably not,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

 J, EVOLUTION," Tanaka, YAF Tanaka, Y", Social selection and the evolution of animal signals,50,1996," Social selection is presented here as a parallel theory to sexual selection and is defined as a selective force that occurs when individuals change their own social behaviors, responding to signals sent by conspecifics in a way to influence the other individuals' fitness. I analyze the joint evolution of a social signal and behavioral responsiveness to the signal by a quantitative-genetic model. The equilibria of average phenotypes maintained by a balance of social selection and natural selection and their stability are examined for two alternative assumptions on behavioral responsiveness, neutral and adaptive. When behavioral responsiveness is neutral on fitness, a rapid evolution by runaway selection occurs only with enough generic covariance between the signal and responsiveness. The condition for rapid evolution also depends on natural selection and the number of interacting individuals. When signals convey some information on signalers (e.g., fighting ability), behavioral responsiveness is adaptive such that a receiver's fitness is also influenced by the signal. Here there is a single point of equilibrium. The equilibrium point and its stability do not depend on the genetic correlation. The condition needed for evolution is that the signal is beneficial for receivers, which results from reliability of the signal. Frequency-dependent selection on responsiveness has almost no influence on the equilibrium and the rate of evolution.","social selection (IGE) is analyzed in a quantitive genetic model. equilibrium depends on the signl being beneficial for the sgnaler, not genetic correlation",,,,mathematical model,,example of a theoreticl model of behavior,maybe,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,not human

We investigated the within-population genetic variability in six quantitative traits associated with this unusual behaviour: fecundity (lifetime number of eggs), time on a patch, number of ovipositions per patch, oviposition rate, ovipositor length and tibia length (a measure of body size). Forty-one wasp isolines were initiated from single parthenogenetic females from three isolated salt marshes, and were maintained for up to eight generations in the greenhouse. We estimated the genetic variance and broad-sense heritability (h(2)) of these traits and tested trait means for differences among isolines (genetic variation) and sites (geographical variation). We found significant genetic variability among isolines for all traits except oviposition rate. The behavioural and morphological traits had similar levels of genetic variance, indicating that the evolvability (ability to respond to selection) of the traits is similarly high. However, the behavioural traits had higher residual variances, resulting in lower heritabilities. Only two traits had significant heritabilities. Fecundity, which is probably a good proxy for fitness, ceteris paribus, varied from on average 26 to 40 eggs per isoline and had the highest h(2), 0.47+/-0.16 (mean+/-SE). Ovipositor length had an h(2) of 0.36+/-0.17. These results suggest that the traits comprising the foraging strategy of A. delicatus should be amenable to selection (e.g. isolines could be selected that lay more eggs per host patch and consequently visit fewer patches). Genetic correlations among traits were numerous and positive. One important prediction from these data is that selection for larger wasps will result in large offspring with greater egg loads and higher oviposition rates. Wasps with this combination of attributes are likely to be more efficient natural enemies for use in biological control. In addition, there was no significant divergence (genetic or otherwise) in wasp morphology or behaviour among the three sites, even though they were separated by 8 km or more.",heritbilities of oviposition rte and number of ovipositions per rate,Anagrus delicatus,salt-marsh parasitoid,Insecta,isolines crossed,inbred lines,"behavioral traits had higher residual variances, resulting in lower heritabilities than morphological traits.

A methodological critique examines difficulties in studying plasticity, including the conceptually critical distinction between functionally adaptive and inevitable aspects of response. It is argued that plasticity studies depend critically upon the genotypic sample, the choice of environmental factors and factor states, and the definition of phenotypic traits. Examples are drawn from recent studies showing adaptive response by genotypes to physical aspects of the environment, as well as to biotic factors such as neighbour density and the presence of bacterial symbionts. Alterations of offspring traits by parental plants of Polygonum persicaria are discussed as a cross-generational aspect of plastic response to environment. Finally, individual plasticity and local ecotypes are examined as alternative bases of species ecological breadth, and methodological problems in distinguishing these alternatives are discussed.",plants,,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES," Lassalle, JMAF Lassalle, JM", Neurogenetic basis of cognition: Facts and hypotheses,35,1995," In the natural setting, cognitive processes direct behavioural adjustments and sometimes result in behavioural novelties which allow the organism to cope with environmental pressures. The resulting behavioural changes exhibit various forms which are dependent upon different causal factors and cognitive processes. Under long-lasting environmental changes, these behavioural adaptations can become hereditary either through the process of cultural transmission or through genetic mechanisms sensitive to selective forces acting on genotypes. In the last few years, neuroethology and behavioural neurosciences have produced an increasing amount of precise knowledge about brain-behaviour relationships, neurobiological bases of cognitive processes and their development. Unfortunately, the approach to these phenomena is basically normative and does not tell us much about non-pathological determinants of individual variation in cognitive and behavioural competences. In contrast, the differential approach has provided some cases of structural variations in the brain which are under genetic control and thus liable to evolve under selective pressures. Brain size, the ratio of various brain structures to the total brain, the number and density of neurons in various parts of the brain and the variations of neuronal circuitry are potential candidates. This paper reviews them and examines their possible behavioural and cognitive outcomes. The issue here is to examine if and where in the brain potential conditions occur that would allow the genetic evolution of cognitive processes.",not relevant,,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

E. Smith), specializing on corn (corn strain) or forage grasses and rice (rice strain), were reared on bermudagrass and corn to assess larval performance and the correlation between performance and adult fitness traits. Traits measured included larval weight and duration, pupal weight and duration, survival to adulthood, adult longevity, preoviposition period, oviposition period, fecundity, percentage of hatch, and number of progeny. None of the immature stage traits were correlated with adult traits for either stain. Specifically, pupal weight was not correlated with number of progeny produced. A quantitative genetic analysis indicated genetic control of larval but not adult traits; however, variation was not additive. The rice strain was more affected by larval host than the corn strain and performed better on its preferred host, bermudagrass, than on corn. However larval performance on the 2 hosts is not mirrored by host specificity in nature. The rice strain is more specialized physiologically but occurs in both habitats in nature, whereas the corn strain is less specialized physiologically but rarely occupies both habitats. Thus, host-plant specialization is likely mediated by behavioral traits in adults rather than physiological ones in larvae.","compared two strains, reared on two different foods,, but didn't measure behavior - not behavior",Spodoptera frugiperda,fall armyworm,Insecta,crosses of two strains,"half-sib, common-garden",not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Multiple mating by   females and multiple paternity,73,1995," Patterns of multiple mating by female Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus) were investigated by observing mating behavior intensively over 5 years. Paternity of litters was assessed through electrophoretic analyses of blood proteins in samples collected from females, offspring, and putative fathers. On average, females mated with four males, and all mated with more than one male. Sixteen percent of 165 litters were multiply sired, but that is probably an underestimate of the rate of multiple paternity. Neither age of the female nor a crude estimate of the operational sex ratio affected number of mates. Litter size did not vary with the number of mates a female had. However, numbers and proportion of juveniles surviving to yearling age tended to increase (nonsignificantly) with the number of mates for mothers. These data suggest that mate choice for ''good genes'' via sperm competition is the most plausible benefit of multiple mating for females.

Using as a historical framework a phylogenetic reconstruction of the history of host associations in the beetle genus Ophraella (Chrysomelidae), we have employed quantitative-genetic methods to screen four species for genetic variation in larval survival, oviposition (in one species only), and feeding responses to their congeners' host plants, in the Asteraceae. We here report results of studies of one species and evaluate the results from all four. Analysis of half-sib/full-sib families and of progenies of wild females of O. notulata, a specialist on Iva (Ambrosiinae), provided evidence of genetic variation in larval consumption of five of six test plants and in adult consumption of four of six. Larval mortality was complete on five plants; only on Ambrosia, a close relative of the natural host, was there appreciable, and genetically variable, survival. Oviposition on Ambrosia showed marginally significant evidence of genetic variation; a more distantly related plant elicited no oviposition at all. In compiling results from four Ophraella species, reported in this and two other papers, we found no evidence of genetic variation in 18 of 39 tests of feeding responses and 14 of 16 tests of larval survival on congeners' hosts. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that absence or paucity of genetic variation may constrain or at least bias the evolution of host associations. The lower incidence of genetic variation in survival than in feeding behavior may imply, according to recent models, that avoidance is a more common evolutionary response to novel plants than adaptation. The usually great disparity between mean performance on congeners' hosts and the species' natural hosts, and an almost complete lack of evidence for negative genetic correlations, argue against the likelihood that speciation has occurred by sympatric host shift. The presence versus apparent absence of genetic variation in consumption was correlated with the propinquity of relationship between the beetle species tested and the species that normally feeds on the test plant, suggesting that the history of host shifts in Ophraella has been guided in part by restrictions on genetic variation. It was also correlated with the propinquity of relationship between a test plant and the beetle's natural host. The contributions of plant relationships and insect relationships, themselves correlated in part, to the pattern of genetic variation, are not readily distinguishable, but together accord with phylogenetic evidence that these and other phytophagous insects adapt most readily to related plants. In this instance, therefore, the macroevolution of an ecologically important character appears to have been influenced by genetic constraints. We hypothesize that absence of the structural prerequisites for genetic variation in complex characters may affect genetic variation and the trajectory of evolution.",genetic variation in larval consumption of test plants and in adult consumption of four to six.  and look at trade offs,Ophraella notulata,beetle,Insecta,half-sib/full-sib families and progenies of wild females,half/full-sib,interesting example - I want to read more,yes,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,not human
 J, EVOLUTION," HAYES, JP   GARLAND, TAF HAYES, JP   GARLAND, T", THE EVOLUTION OF ENDOTHERMY - TESTING THE AEROBIC CAPACITY MODEL,49,1995," One of the most important events in vertebrate evolution was the acquisition of endothermy, the ability to use metabolic heat production to elevate body temperature above environmental temperature. Several verbal models have been proposed to explain the selective factors leading to the evolution of endothermy. Of these, the aerobic capacity model has received the most attention in recent years. The aerobic capacity model postulates that selection acted mainly to increase maximal aerobic capacity (or associated behavioral abilities) and that elevated resting metabolic rate evolved as a correlated response. Here we evaluate the implicit evolutionary and genetic assumptions of the aerobic capacity model. In light of this evaluation, we assess the utility of phenotypic and genetic correlations for testing the aerobic capacity model. Collectively, the available intraspecific data for terrestrial vertebrates support the notion of a positive phenotypic correlation between resting and maximal rates of oxygen consumption within species. Interspecific analyses provide mixed support for this phenotypic correlation. We argue, however, that assessments of phenotypic or genetic correlations within species and evolutionary correlations among species (from comparative data) are of limited utility, because they may not be able to distinguish between the aerobic capacity model and plausible alternatives, such as selection acting directly on aspects of thermoregulatory abilities. We suggest six sources of information that may help shed light on the selective factors important during the evolution of high aerobic metabolic rates and, ultimately, the attainment of endothermy. Of particular interest will be attempts to determine, using a combination of mechanistic physiological and quantitative-genetic approaches, whether a positive genetic correlation between resting and maximal rates of oxygen consumption is an ineluctable feature of vertebrate physiology.",not relevant,,,,position paper,,advocate for use of quantitative genetics to evaluate the aerobic capacity model of evolution of endothermy,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

We measured maximum sprint speeds, endurance on a treadmill, cost of transport, and aerobic capacity (VO(2)max) at a mean body temperature of 30.8 C. The maximum sprint speed for both Heloderma species averaged 1.7 km/h, which is among the lowest recorded for lizards. A typical Heloderma had an endurance time of 16.0 min at 1.0 km/h, which is higher than expected for a lizard of this size at 31 C. At lower speeds, adult Heloderma could run for prolonged periods. The cost of transport for a 500 g Heloderma at 0.4 km/h was 0.46 ml O-2g(-1) km(-1), which is comparable to the cost of transport in other lizards. The two Heloderma species showed no significant differences in VO(2)max, cost of locomotion, endurance, or sprint speeds. Neither cost of locomotion nor aerobic capacity differed between captive and wild Heloderma. At 31 C, helodermatids had a high VO(2)max, resulting in the highest factorial aerobic scope (30.4) of any lizard measured to date. The high aerobic capacity of Heloderma seems surprising for a sedentary lizard but may be advantageous during intensive male-male agonistic behaviors. Males had significantly higher VO(2)max than did females, suggesting that sexual selection may favor males with high aerobic capacities.","measured max sprint spreed, endurance, cost of transport, and aerobic capacity  - not quantitative genetics",helodermatida,lizards,Reptilia,measured speeds and aerobic capacity in lizard species,,not quantitative genetics,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

We estimated the heritability of maximal sprint speed treadmill endurance and tail length, a morphometric trait that may affect locomotor performance, as well as phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations between these traits. Gravid females were captured in the field and held in the laboratory under standardized conditions until giving birth; traits were then measured on their offspring. Prior to ge genetic analyses, we used multiple regressions to remove the effects of such covariates as body size (mass and snout-vent length), dam age, and length of time dams were held in captivity prior to parturition. When we examined the residual characters, heritability was low and statistically nonsignificant for speed but relatively high for both endurance (0.46) and tail length (0.51). None of the phenotypic, genetic, or environmental correlations between traits was statistically significant Thus, we found no evidence for a trade-off between speed and endurance; these results are consistent with those reported in two previous studies of squamate reptiles (the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis and the fence lizard Sceloporus occidentalis). The lack of a negative genetic correlation between speed and endurance suggests that these aspects of locomotor abilities are relatively free to evolve independently, such that natural selection could increase both speed and endurance. However, the species studied to date have low to moderate capacities for speed and endurance, as compared with other squamates.

The findings of triploidy in forest trees stimulate the development of a quantitative genetic model to estimate the nature of gene action. The model is based on clonally replicated triploid progenies derived from a two-level population and individual-within-population mating design in which offspring have a double dose of alleles from the parent and a single dose of alleles from the other parent. With the same genetic assumptions of a diploid model, except non-Mendelian behavior at meiosis, and the experimental variances estimated from a linear statistical model, total genetic variances in the triploid progenies are separated into additive, dominance, and epistatic components. In addition, by combining the new model with the already existing model based on disomic expression, the partitioning of additive, dominant, and epistatic variances can be obtained for a mixed diploid/triploid F-1 progeny population.

Sperm competition experiments in the laboratory show that last male sperm precedence occurs (as it does in many other taxa) although the mechanism is unknown (as in most other taxa). Empirically-derived values were used to construct a mathematical model of sperm competition in the zebra finch. The model indicates that precedence occurs as a consequence of: (i) the temporal pattern of pair copulations; (ii) the rate at which sperm are lost from the female tract; and (iii) more sperm being transferred during extra-pair copulations than during pair copulations. The latter effect is a consequence of males seeking extra-pair copulations after their own pair copulation period has ended. The effect of sperm numbers on the pattern of sperm precedence may be further increased by: (i) extra-pair males increasing ejaculate size (sperm numbers) (for which there is no evidence); (ii) extra-pair males being of a better quality and transferring more sperm or better quality sperm (for which there is some evidence); and (iii) cryptic female choice. Females eject over 99% of sperm following insemination; if they eject fewer sperm from males chosen as extra-pair copulation partners, the potential for cryptic female choice is considerable. However, this is still being investigated. The model also predicts the optimal time for an extra-pair copulation to occur (from either a male or female perspective). A comparison between the predicted and observed pattern suggests that the optimal timing of extra-pair copulations is constrained in both sexes.",not quantitative genetics,Taeniopygia guttata,zebra finch,Aves,mathematical model of sperm competition,,not quantitative genetics,no,,x,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Clear assessment of the ecological and evolutionary impact of changing climatic temperature requires a natural system in which populations exhibit a direct unambiguous fitness response to thermal fluctuation. I monitored nests of a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) with temperature-dependent sex determination to investigate the causal relationship between local climatic variation in temperature and offspring sex ratio. Consistent with theoretical predictions, annual offspring sex ratio was highly correlated with mean July air temperature, validating concerns about the effect of climate change on population demography. This correlation implies that even modest increases in mean temperature (<2 degrees C) may drastically skew the sex ratio. Statistical evaluation of the variance in climate change indicates that an increase in mean temperature of 4 degrees C would effectively eliminate production of male offspring. Quantitative genetic analyses and behavioral data suggest that populations with temperature-dependent sex determination may be unable to evolve rapidly enough to counteract the negative fitness consequences of rapid global temperature change. Populations of species with temperature-dependent sex determination may serve as ideal indicators of the biological impact of global temperature change.",not quantitative genetics,Chrysemys picta,painted turtles,Reptilia,observed sex ratios in the field,,"""quantittive genetic analysis suggest tath populations with temperature dependent sex determination may be unable to evolve rapidly enough to counteract negative fitness consequences of rapid global temperature change"" - didn't actually do quant gen",no,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

The prairie-grouse complex (genus Tympanuchus), distributed throughout the central United States and Canada, contains three sister taxa believed to have originated from the expansion of late Pleistocene refugial populations.  We assayed mitochondrial-DNA (mtDNA) restriction-site and allozyme variation in prairie grouse obtained from localities throughout their current range in North America to examine the nature and timing of events promoting differentiation in Tympanuchus.  The genetic data were not consistent with Pleistocene isolation of sufficient duration to allow a taxonomically or geographically structured pattern of genetic variation to emerge.  No clear genetic differences among species were observed.  Allozymes could not distinguish populations belonging to different species and frequencies were generally similar across taxa.  The mtDNA differentiation was characterized by a predominant haplotype shared by all taxa; the remainder (15) were generally infrequent and closely related to the prevalent (and presumably ancestral) haplotype.  The presence of unique mtDNA haplotypes within species and absence of certain allozyme alleles from particular taxa implied a degree of isolation and restrictions to gene flow.  However, the mtDNA haplotypes did not sort phylogenetically, which suggests recent common ancestry of the lineages and may explain the lack of congruence between genetic variation and species designations.  Despite the absence of quantitative genetic differentiation, considerable morphological and behavioral differences are apparent among the putative species.  Adult male plumage, vocalization structures, and courtship behaviors form the basis for taxonomic divisions among prairie grouse, but, considering their close association with reproduction, such characters may be subject to sexual selection and may evolve rapidly relative to mtDNA or allozymes.",not quantitative genetics andd not behavior,Tympanuchus,prairie grouse,Aves,mtDNA and allozymes to investigate genetic differentiation,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Quantitative genetics can also provide an empirical guide and a conceptual framework for the application of molecular genetics. The success of molecular genetics in elucidating the genetic basis of behavioral disorders has largely relied on a reductionistic one gene, one disorder (OGOD) approach in which a single gene is necessary and sufficient to develop a disorder.

The aspects of genetic improvement programs in livestock production pertinent to animal welfare and animal well-being are reviewed. A link is made between the evolutionary processes of adaptation and domestication and animal well-being. Animal behavior is a component of all these. Thus, the genetics of behavior may provide clues to the well-being of farm animal populations, and it will also be of relevance to public opinion issues of animal welfare. Many expressions of behavior by domestic livestock may be influenced by those processes that change gene as well as genotypic frequencies such as inbreeding, drift, and artificial selection. The environment in which the individual lives will also play a role, along with the interaction between genotype and environment. Selection for or against such behaviors as aggressiveness, docility, response to stress, and certain sexual behaviors in some livestock species has often been successful. This points to the existence of additive genetic variation for behavior, and scope for the inclusion of behavioral traits into selection programs, if these measures are shown to be related to welfare. Negative relationships between behaviors associated with well-being and traits of economic importance have been reported in most livestock species. However, estimates of genetic parameters, especially genetic correlations between objective measures of well-being and production traits, are scarce. There have been no comprehensive studies of the welfare of transgenic animals reported in the scientific literature.

Cyclic voltammetry of these compounds showed a well ordered electrochemical behaviour with reductions in both the metal and ligand. All complexes showed two well defined electrode couples, Ni-I/Ni-II and Ni-II/Ni-III. The dependence of the electrochemical parameters on the solvent, supporting electrolyte, scan rate and the nature of the ligands is discussed. Application of the OTTLE cell technique to the study of the redox chemistry of the nickel(II) pigments tested proved efficient for the spectral and electrochemical characterization of the various oxidation states. The spectropotentiostatic experiments provided redox potentials, n values, close to those obtained by controlled potential coulometry and in agreement with those values predicted from the bulk cyclic voltammetry. The estimated standard electrode potential (E(0)) values agreed well with those obtained by Nernstian analysis, and facilitated the acquisition of E and n values, which are not readily obtained by conventional techniques. This was possible even for quasi-reversible reactions where the peak separation does not yield accurate n values. Exhaustive electrolysis of the small volume of solution in the OTTLE ensured the quantitative generation of a particular redox state without interference from extraneous redox reactions. The effect of an additional aromatic ring is to provide an additional redox couple. The electrochemical and spectral behaviours were in good agreement, which suggests that the phenomenon of colour fading in the complex and electrochemical changes produce similar trends.",not relevant,,,,,,not relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

 J, ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY AND SYSTEMATICS," MORENO, GAF MORENO, G"," GENETIC ARCHITECTURE, GENETIC BEHAVIOR, AND CHARACTER EVOLUTION",25,1994," Nonadditive gene interaction or epistasis is a central component of hypotheses that postulate a creative role for small populations and founder events in character evolution and speciation. Because quantitative or small effect variation is considered to be the basis of evolutionary change, the claim that this variation shows mostly additive behavior has represented a serious obstacle for these hypotheses. The literature on classical phenotypic genetics as well as the contemporary counterpart of this work, developmental genetics, harbors a considerable wealth of information relevant to the issue of gene-character relationship. In particular, recent studies of gene interaction in Drosophila developmental genetics provide important insights into the structure and behavior of nonadditive gene action. It is proposed that the importance of these studies for population genetics lies in suggesting that the small-effect of at least some genetic variation can hide a potential for strong phenotypic effects which can be expressed through interlocus interactions within sets of functionally related loci. At the population level this genetic behavior implies that strong effects should become apparent in quantitative variation when the genotypic frequencies of the population are substantially disturbed. That at least some quantitative variation can show strong interaction effects with substantial disturbance of the population genotypic combinations is supported by results from quantitative genetic analyses of chromosome and inbred lines and long-term artificial selection on quantitative characters. An experiment comparing the genetic variance resulting from the same set of wild third-chromosomes in a wild type and mutant backgrounds revealed substantial amounts of unexpressed strong effects for a typical quantitative character in a wild population of Drosophila melanogaster. The claim that quantitative variation will show strong epistatic behavior under population disturbance is of fundamental importance for theories that postulate a positive role for small population size and population bottlenecks in phenotypic evolution and speciation.",not behavior,,,,,,not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

This study was designed to assess adaptability of traits related to dispersal and colonization in the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. Defining the flexibility of mite dispersal and life-history is necessary to understand the response of mites to changes in the spatial and temporal structure of their environment. We found significant direct response to bidirectional selection on aerial dispersal behaviour after eight and five generations of selection. The realized heritability estimated from these lines (h(2)=0.28) was in close agreement with that estimated in a previous sib-analysis on the base population. As predicted from the sib-analysis, there were no correlated responses in fecundity or sex ratio. Crosses between selected lines indicated that the dispersal behaviour was under weak maternal influence and that non-dispersal may be a slightly dominant trait. Mite sensitivity or resistance to starvation or desiccation, the major environmental cues triggering their behaviour, changed in response to selection. Results suggest that variation in aerial dispersal behaviour is largely attributed to different sensitivity or resistance to environmental stress and that genetic variation in this behaviour may be maintained by selection for dispersal when food resources become depleted and against when food is abundant.

Each trait was scored on approximately 540 offspring and their 47 dams captured in the wild while gravid. Correlations of the meristic traits with body mass at birth, dam's snout-vent length and body mass, litter size, and number of days each dam was held under laboratory conditions prior to giving birth were removed by computing residuals from multiple regression equations. Narrow-sense heritabilities (estimated by restricted maximum likelihood) of residuals were high for temporal scale counts (0.59), moderately large for ventral (0.29) and subcaudal scale counts (0.41), and low (in the range 0-0.12) for the other five traits. Probably as a consequence of the low statistical power of significance testing under restricted maximum likelihood, only the heritability for temporal scales was significantly different from zero. Phenotypic (r(p) = 0.25) and genetic (r(g) = 0.67) correlations between ventrals and subcaudals were positive and significant. Phenotypic correlations between the head scale counts were generally low; however, the genetic correlations were larger, suggesting relatively tight integration at the genetic level. Phenotypic correlations between the head and body scale counts were generally low, but several genetic correlations were large (e.g., r(g) = 0.59 for ventrals and infralabials, r(g) = 0.59 for subcaudals and supralabials). These data indicate that scale counts from different regions of the body are not evolutionarily independent characters, despite their different spatial and temporal relationships during development.

A relationship was found between the child's behaviour and the mother's outcome response at 6 months. Essentially, for the mother, the qualitative outcome response of the Maternal Thermal injury Response Pattern was associated with the severity of the child's thermal injury and Are quantitative General Health Questionnaire scores were associated with a preview tendency to depression and increased stress on the mother existing prior to the accident. For the child no thermal injury factor appeared to affect behavioural outcome. The child with disturbed behaviour following a thermal injury, however, was more likely to have a mother with a history of depression, and added stress (lower socioeconomic status, and additional worries) and have a mother who was blamed for the accident. Thus, mothers whose child has a more severe thermal injury will take longer to come to terms with if ('rationalize' the thermal injury) and those mothers who were most stressed prior to the accident and who had a previous tendency to depression, will have more psychiatric morbidity (a higher GHQ score) as a result.

It is unclear, however, whether this pattern reflects relatively low additive-genetic variation, relatively high residual variation (i.e. non-additive and environmental effects) or bath. A standard, half-sib breeding design was used to estimate narrow-sense heritabilities and coefficients of additive-genetic variation( CVA) for a life-history trait (total fecundity), a morphological trait (wing length) and a behavioural trait (allocation of eggs among available resources) in two outbred populations of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. Heritabilities of fecundity and wing length were high in both populations whereas the heritability of egg-laying behaviour was low but non-zero. In contrast, estimates of 'evolvability', which depend on CVA, were highest for fecundity, intermediate for egg-laying behaviour and lowest for wing length. These results resemble those from a recent survey of Drosophila studies and suggest that the typically low heritabilities of behavioural or life-history traits are better explained by high residual variation than by low additive-genetic variation. Phenotypic and genetic correlations were generally not significant except for a positive relationship between wing length and fecundity. No evidence was obtained of a trade-off or underlying functional relationship between the number of eggs laid and the pattern of egg dispersion among available resources.","estimated genetic prameters of fecundity, wing length, and allocation of eggs among avvailable resources",Callosobruchus maculatus,seed beetle,Insecta,half-sib breeding design,half-sib,heritability of egg laying behavior was low but on zero.

Poultry offers a whole series of advantages (short intervals between generations, high reproductiveness, including that of the females, permanent hybridisation) for the application of approaches to breeding based on population genetics. The remarkable progress made in the field of bioengineering processes for enhancing the reproductiveness of female mammals is of no significance (at least at the present time) for contemporary poultry breeding.   A more realistic view should also be taken of the prospects of molecular genetic advances for practical poultry breeding.   Since most characteristics relevant to breeding are polygenic in origin, only quantitative genetics offers any possibility of working on such characteristics.   As the key poultry production lies in hybrid breeding, the only research projects of any practical relevance are those which take adequate account of pure-breeding: hybrid relationships.   In the field of breeding research, due attention should be paid to the study of environmentally relevant'' quantitative characteristics (c.f. utilization of energy and nutrients, and N and P excretion), and the improvement of product quality (example: egg composition vis-a-vis the cholosterol issue). Pronouncements on the influence of behavioural characteristics on breeding are likewise dependent on due determination of genetic population parameters, and hence quantitative approaches are of broad interest to behavioural genetics, too.   On the other hand, attention should also be directed in future towards testing the effectiveness of individual diseases, which would provide special justification for concentrating on the search for suitable molecular genetic markers.",key to poultry breeding lies in quantitative genetics,Gallus gallus domesticus,poultry,Aves,review,,probably not going to use in chapter,no,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

We analyse a dynamic model of these adaptive scenarios in which the rate of change of the mean trait value is an increasing function of the fitness gradient (i.e. the rate of increase of individual fitness with the individual's trait value). Such models have been employed in evolutionary game theory and are often appropriate both for the evolution of quantitative genetic traits and for the behavioural adjustment of phenotypically plastic traits. The dynamics of the adaptation of several different ecologically important traits can result in characters that minimize individual fitness and can preclude evolution towards characters that maximize individual fitness. We discuss biological circumstances that are likely to produce such adaptive failures for situations involving foraging, predator avoidance, competition and coevolution. The results argue for greater attention to dynamical stability in models of the evolution of continuous traits.",analyze a dynamic model which can be approprite for behavioral adjustment of phenotypically pastic trits,,,,model,,not  really useful,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

However, for wild plant populations there is little information on the amount of genetic variation for such traits. We estimated broad- and narrow-sense heritability of floral and reproductive traits for two populations of the perennial wildflower Penstemon centranthifolius, using a paternal half-sib crossing design in one case, and clonal propagation of ramets from different genets in the other. In both designs, most traits were significantly heritable, including nectar production, corolla length and width, inflorescence length and total flower production. Flowering date was significantly heritable for the crosses, but not for the clones, while nectar sugar concentration was not significantly heritable in either design. Genetic correlations were in some cases strong, and in some cases differed greatly from the corresponding phenotypic correlations.

The finding that foraging success of paired females improves in copula is discussed in light of evidence that multiple paternity also confers genetic benefits. Nonvirgin females face frequent daylong visits to their webs by dominant, kleptoparasitic males. Females reduce prey losses by engaging some males in 2-6 h of aspermic copulatory courtship. During this ''preinsemination phase'' of copulation, females increase the percentage of prey they consume from 25.1% to 49.0%. Female sexual receptivity depends more on recent foraging success than on phenotypic attributes of males, whereas sperm-use patterns are related to physical and behavioral qualities of mates. The preinsemination phase of copulation is well designed both to improve the foraging success of females and test male quality: (1) it is strenuous and exacting for the male but inactive for the female, (2) genitalia are continuously joined and detached, keeping the male occupied but maintaining freedom for the female to pursue prey, and (3) it is lengthy, which reduces male prey stealing for a substantial portion of his visit. Despite the foraging benefits of remating, females reject 66% of their suitors, probably because remating entails costs and provides diminishing genetic benefits.",female sexual receptivity depends more on recent foraging success than on phenotypic attributes of males - not quantitative genetics,Neriene litigiosa,sierra dome spiders,Arachnida,behavioral studies,,not quantitative genetics,no,,x,x,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

In this paper, I estimate the amount of genetic variation in oviposition preference and larval performance present in two California populations of a cosmopolitan pest of stored legumes, Callosobruchus maculatus(Bruchidae: Coleoptera), and examine whether positive genetic correlations exist between preference and performance. High levels of genetic variation in both preference and performance were detected in one population (Bay Area population, h2 = 0.73 for oviposition preference), but not in another population (Davis population). A second estimate of the amount of genetic variation for oviposition preference in the Bay Area population, after three generations of laboratory rearing, supports the hypothesis that the absence of significantly nonzero heritabilities in the Davis population is probably due to the three generations of laboratory rearing prior to the start of the experiment.

 J, QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY," REEVE, HK   SHERMAN, PWAF REEVE, HK   SHERMAN, PW", ADAPTATION AND THE GOALS OF EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH,68,1993," Adaptation is and has always been a slippery concept. Even among contemporary evolutionary biologists there is no consensus about how to identify adaptive traits. Most definitions of adaptation incorporate elements of history. Among these, some require that adaptive traits be built by natural selection for their current roles. Others take a phylogenetic perspective and require that adaptations be derived relative to traits Of antecedent taxa. Still other definitions require evidence of functional design in the biological machinery underlying the trait, implying a history of selective fine-tuning.   The historical definitions are most useful for addressing questions about evolutionary history like, ''What was the phylogenetic trajectory of a phenotype with current utility?,'' or ''How does a trait's current use relate to its original function?''  Historical definitions are less useful for addressing questions about phenotype existence like, ''Why do certain phenotypes predominate over others in nature?'' This is because history-laden definitions often fail to classify as adaptations traits that are maintained by natural selection. Obviously it is important to employ a definition that is appropriate for the research question being pursued. Indeed, the (mis)application of history-laden definitions to questions of phenotype existence has created the illusion that nonadaptive traits abound in nature and caused widespread doubt about the importance of natural selection in molding phenotypes.   To circumvent these problems we propose a nonhistorical definition of adaptation. In our view, an adaptation is a phenotypic variant that results in the highest fitness among a specified set of variants in a given environment. This definition treats adaptation as a relative concept, sets forth operational criteria for identifying the phenotypic traits to which the concept applies, and decouples adaptations from the evolutionary mechanisms that generate them. Natural selection theory predicts that among a specific set of alternatives the most adapted phenotype will be the one that predominates in a given environment. This is a testable proposition. When it is false the frequency of the trait must be due to nonselective processes such as drift, migration, selection acting on a correlated trait, or recent changes in the environment. Teleonomic demonstrations of adaptation are a special case of our suggested analysis because inferring a trait's ''function'' implies the application of a specific fitness criterion (e.g., optimal design) to rank alternative phenotypes.   The logical structure of our definition allows us to confront five recent challenges to adaptationism, namely that: (1) it is impossible to identify adaptive traits without a knowledge of phylogeny, which can reveal constraints on adaptation, (2) genetic correlations among different traits usually prevent or retard ascent toward adaptive peaks, (3) ''developmental constraints'' limit the operation of natural selection, (4) the complex and highly ordered phenotypes studied by adaptationists can be explained most parsimoniously as manifestations of simple mechanisms, and without reference to natural selection, and (5) it is impossible to study the adaptive significance of human behavior because natural selection has not had time to operate on humans in our ''changed'' environments. We show that these challenges rest on inadequate specification of the components of adaptation.",provide a non-historical definition of adaptation,,,,position paper,,not useful,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Adults of the noctuid moth Autographa gamma undertake seasonal migrations into areas where they are unable to breed continuously. Individuals migrate into Britain each spring, and offspring of these migrants probably return in autumn to over-wintering areas in North Africa and the Middle East. However, the existence of these return migrations has been questioned.   2. Insects usually migrate during the adults' pre-reproductive period (PRP). The length of this period is therefore an index of migratory potential since individuals with longer PRPs have more time to express their potential for flight and to travel further before becoming sexually mature.   3. Offspring of insects from Morocco, Britain and Germany showed that, under both long and short photoperiods, PRP increased with latitude over the range 34-53-degrees-N. There were significant genotype-environment interactions in the effect of photoperiod on length of PRP.   4.

The involvement of several genes encourages the application of classical genetics to elucidate the genetic basis of alcohol abuse. Quantitative genetics can provide evidence for modes of inheritance and estimates of gene number. Therefore, inbred strains and selective breeding programmes have been used to demonstrate a genetic basis for the physiological and behavioural effects of ethanol in rodents. Neurochemical studies have shown that ethanol has effects on membrane fluidity, and on membrane receptors, ion channels and enzymes (Fig. 1). Comparison of these in animal lines selected for a particular response (or lack of response) to ethanol has disclosed differences in membrane composition (notably in polysialogangliosides), and in the functioning of NaK-ATPase, Na+ channels and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptors. Not all of these effects were observed at relevant ethanol concentrations, but differences in the properties of GABA(A) receptors between lines are the most compelling. Thus classical genetic strategies, while labour intensive with respect to the generation and maintenance of animal lines, have proven useful in dissecting the molecular, cellular and behavioural effects of alcohol and their genetic variability",quantittive genetics cacn provide evidence for modes of inheritancce - especially for ethanol,,,,review,,not useful,no,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

However, in some species a very high frequency of mating occurs, indicating that individuals copulate many more times than are necessary for fertilization. If copulation behaviour carries costs, then the question arises as to how individuals of both sexes benefit from repeated matings with a single partner. For a male, a high frequency of copulation appears to be advantageous in securing or assuring paternity when his sperm is in competition with those of another male. Since copulation is likely to be as costly for females as it is for males, it is necessary to seek adaptive explanations from the female perspective. Attention is now being focused on why females should copulate repeatedly with a single male.",why do some species have high frequencies of mating?,,,,review,,not relevant,no,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Recent comparative studies have emphasized the possible importance of such correlated responses in affecting the evolution of traits, including some behaviors, which are of little adaptive significance, or even maladaptive. However, it is also possible for traits with major effects on fitness, such as brain size, to evolve entirely by correlated response. Other traits that do not appear to have evolved at all may have been subject to much directional selection, simply to prevent their evolution by correlated response.

A UCBR only performs well if its single parts act concertedly. Consequently, these parts are restricted in the in their independent variations (= slackness) and must covary more intensely in their dimensions. These units of covarying characters (= UCCs) are extracted by means of morphometric techniques (R-analyses, e.g. UPGMA cluster analysis); their final interpretation as UCBRs is mainly based on behavioural arguments. This approach proves to be consistent with the synthetic theory of evolution over an interface to quantitative genetics. One of its advantages is to distil unexpected character complexes sensu UCBRs within a monophyletic group, i.e., those predictable neither by traditional morphology nor by ecomorphology. This approach is successfully demonstrated using skeletal measurements in two avian clades: finches (Carduelidae) and pigeons (Columbiformes). The analyses were carried out interspecifically within each clade. UCBR-patterns common to both clades include 1. the splitting of the flight apparatus into an engine supporting and a flight performance-manoeuvrability portion, and 2. a tight linkage between feeding and hindlimb locomotion. Both clades differ 1. in their levels of morphological integration, 2. in their phenotypic character variances, and 3. in the number of UCCs: in all three cases low in finches, high in pigeons. These discrepancies between the clades are explained as being due to different phylogenetic ages, young in finches vs. old in pigeons: the pigeons have had more time to occupy more niches and to introduce a greater number of adaptational novelties.",not behavior,,,,morphometric approach,,not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

With few exceptions, researchers who have used these methods for the analysis of twin data have assumed that their data were multinormal and, consequently, have used normal-theory estimation methods. It is shown that normal-theory methods produce biased genetic and environmental parameter estimates when data are censored. Specifically, with censored data, (1) normal-theory estimates of narrow-sense heritability are either positively or negatively biased, whereas (2) estimates of shared-familial environmental variance are always biased downward. An alternative method for estimating genetic and environmental parameters from censored twin data is proposed. The method is called genetic Tobit factor analysis (GTFA) and is an extension of the Tobit factor analysis model developed by Muthen (Br. J. Math. Stat. Psychol. 42, 241-250, 1989).

The opportunity for sexual selection and the intensity of directional sexual selection on body length increased as the population density declined within a season for a population in a small, disjunct patch of host plant, Senecio anonymus. In a larger, dispersed population, both measures of selection were greater in host plant patches of low rather than high adult density when the population was sampled at peak density. Under conditions of higher density, males were more likely to share plants, larger males were less likely to monopolize patches of host plant to which females were attracted for mating, and smaller males were more likely to mate in the presence of large males. Thus, resource defense polygyny collapsed under high density, obviating the advantage of size in territory control, and resulted in scramble competition among males for mates. The population exhibited significant additive genetic variation for body length. This suggests that natural selection acting on other components of fitness favors smaller size or that the direction of sexual selection on size fluctuates between generations in response to the between-year variation in population density.

In this paper, the three competing methods (the coevolutionarily stable community (CSC), the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), and quantitative genetic recursion (QGR)) are compared in models using a common ecological setting. Specific predictions of the CSC model have been used to understand features of character displacement among Cnemido-phorous lizards on islands off Mexico, Anolis lizards in the Lesser Antilles and Galapagos finches. Nonetheless, the validity of the approach has been repeatedly questioned. Conceptually the three formalisms vary in the degree to which within species variability is allowed in the models. The predictions of the CSC are found not to be robust to even small violation of its fundamental assumption of absolute species monomorphy. We show by simulation and analytical observations that the CSC is not valid under frequency dependent selection, and that the ESS is the limiting case of QGR as intraspecific phenotypic variation goes to zero. Thus the ESS and the QGR models agree closely when the between-phenotype component (BPC) of the niche width is small. However, as the BPC increases, quantitative discrepancies between ESS and QGR predictions increase, although model behavior remains qualitatively similar.

However, this failure is not due to anything intrinsic to the inclusive-fitness viewpoint.  It stems from an essentially quantitative genetic feature of the model, an attempt to separate fitness terms from genetic terms.  A general rule is provided for determining when such a separation is justified.  This rule is used to show how Price's covariance equation is related to standard quantitative genetic results and to derive quantitative genetic equations for inclusive fitness and group selection.  It also shows that the group-selection model is no more general than the inclusive-fitness viewpoint.  These models serve a role that is different from, but not inferior to, population-genetics models.  Although they are less exact under some conditions, like quantitative genetic models in general, they provide us with measurable parameters.","provides a general rule for partitioning fitness terms from genetic terms, and is used to show how Price's equation is related to standard quantitative genetic results",,,,mathematical model,,I don't think it's overly relevant,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

These methods are more consistent with a conceptualization of development as an ongoing, continuous process, rather than as increases or decreases in a trait between two discrete time points.  Recent developmental behavior genetic models have focused on continuity and change in the genetic and environmental influences underlying phenotypes.  In contrast, we present a model for genetic and environmental influences on phenotypic development per se.  In this model, we adapted multiple regression methods developed for twin designs (DeFries and Fulker, 1985) to a parent-offspring adoption design and to a multivariate framework in which repeated measurements are decomposed into orthogonal polynomial trends.  We applied these analyses to the development of IQ during infancy and early childhood using parent-offspring data from adoptive and nonadoptive families in the Colorado Adoption Project.  The results suggested familial environmental influences on children's mean IQ for ages 1-4 but environmental influences specific to fathers' cognitive ability on children's IQ development.

Sherman & Westneat (1988) raised several objections to this hypothesis, one of which was that mechanisms affecting remating frequency are unlikely to be homologous in the two sexes.

Predation often has strong, but variable effects on prey. Variation in predator impacts on prey can often be explained by variation in prey behavior. Many systems have prey that show ineffective antipredator behavior; these prey thus do poorly with predators. Ineffective antipredator behavior can be explained by conflicting demands within or across situations. Alternatively, ineffective behavior might be explained by phylogenetic, genetic or developmental constraints. The study of constraints can yield useful insights; however, there are also important limitations on the value of these approaches for adaptation-oriented evolutionary ecologists. I used an integrative approach to study the responses of streamside salamanders, Ambystoma barbouri, to predatory sunfish. A. barbouri suffers heavy sunfish predation due to relatively high prey activity in fish pools in the day-time. A phylogenetic perspective suggests that this species has actually evolved in the wrong direction with regard to this key ''bad'' behavior.

In principle, fitness is defined in terms of a range of phenotypes that are the product of a single genotype; studies of such phenotypes are usually restricted to morphology. However, behavioral and developmental traits are subject to selection as well. Darwin used arguments concerning genetics (variation), developm(:nt (embryology), ecology (geographical variation), and behavior (instinct) to support his theory. Here, we focus on dynamic programming methods to account for selection on such traits. Our intent is to explain the basic ideas of dynamic programming and to explore their applicability to the difficult problems of linking developmental, behavioral, and evolutionary phenomena. We shall show that, in principle, one can relate measurable physiological and ecological variables such as developmental times and behavioral traits to the fitness of an organism.

Both sibling analysis and artificial selection strongly evidenced the existence of additive genetic covariances between flight capacity and life-history traits such as developmental time, adult body weight at emergence, age at first reproduction and fecundity. Flight capacity was negatively correlated with adult body weight, the number of eggs laid during the first 5 days of adult life and total fecundity, whereas it was positively correlated with developmental time from egg-hatch to adult emergence, age at first reproduction and adult life span. These results, which indicate that increased flight capacity is accompanied by a slower developmental rate, smaller body size, delayed oviposition and less fecundity, resulting in a lower population growth rate, contrast with the colonizing syndrome that highly mobile individuals show rapid development, early reproduction and high fecundity.

 J, PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE," GABBAY, FHAF GABBAY, FH", BEHAVIOR-GENETIC STRATEGIES IN THE STUDY OF EMOTION,3,1992," Behavior-genetic studies of emotionality in rats and human studies of adult personality and childhood temperament provide evidence of genetic effects on emotion-relevant traits.  Twin studies of autonomic reactivity suggest that psychophysiologic responses to stress are heritable.  Genetic analyses of fears reveal that the magnitude of genetic influence varies across fears and across development.  Finally, recent findings in psychiatric genetics shed light on the role of heritable variation in emotional functioning in major psychiatric disorders.  Thus, there is evidence from a variety of sources that characteristics relevant to emotion are influenced by genetic factors.  However, behavior-genetic methods generally have not been applied in laboratory-based studies of the psychophysiologic, cognitive, or expressive correlates of emotion.  Because recent developments in quantitative genetics permit us to go beyond the simple estimation of heritability, a broader application of behavior-genetic strategies to the study of emotion, one which incorporates elicitation of emotion in the laboratory, promises to elucidate the interrelationships among the components of emotional systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,human

Although there is no genetic correlation between offspring size and offspring number, present growth and present reproduction are both strongly positively correlated genetically with future reproduction, and early maturity is genetically correlated with larger clutch size.  Although the ubiquity of antagonistic pleiotropy has been recently questioned, there are peculiarities of cyclical parthenogenesis that could lead to positive life-history covariance even when negative covariance would be expected in a similar sexual species.  These include the influence of nonadditive gene action on evolution in clonally reproducing organisms, and the periodic release of hidden genetic variance within populations of cyclical parthenogens.   Examination of matrix similarity, using the bootstrap for distribution-free hypothesis testing, reveals no evidence to suggest that the genetic covariance matrices differ between the populations.  However, there is considerable evidence that the phenotypic and environmental covariance matrices differ between populations.

Quantitative geneticists have discussed the possibility that particular types of signals, and preferences for those types, are inherited together.

The research also converges on the remarkable conclusion that these environmental influences make two children in the same family as different from one another as are pairs of children selected randomly from the population.   The theme of the target article is that environmental differences between children in the same family (called ""nonshared environment"") represent the major source of environmental variance for personality, psychopathology, and cognitive abilities.  One example of the evidence that supports this conclusion involves correlations for pairs of adopted children reared in the same family from early in life.  Because these children share family environment but not heredity, their correlation directly estimates the importance of shared family environment.  For most psychological characteristics, correlations for adoptive ""siblings"" hover near zero, which implies that the relevant environmental influences are not shared by children in the same family.  Although it has been thought that cognitive abilities represent an exception to this rule, recent data suggest that environmental variance that affects IQ is also of the nonshared variety after adolescence.   The article has three goals:  (1) To describe quantitative genetic methods and research that lead to the conclusion that nonshared environment is responsible for most environmental variation relevant to psychological development, (2) to discuss specific nonshared environmental influences that have been studied to date, and (3) to consider relationships between nonshared environmental influences and behavioral differences between children in the same family.

Analysis of these differences using parthenogenetic offspring groups permitted the estimation of genotypic values and revealed a high degree of genetic variability that is evident among related as well as unrelated bees.  The results obtained from related groups are of particular importance, since they demonstrated the existence of strong genetic variability among individuals of the same colony.  Quantitative analysis yielded high estimates of additive genetic effects and low estimates of dominance effects.  Selection of individual workers resulted in an explicit increase in genetic variance of the next generation (G1).  However, selection of bees from the parthenogenetic G1 generation, which was done to obtain parthenogenetic G2 offspring, did not lead to further improvement in selection.  This observation suggests that recombination of linked genes underlying proboscis extension reflex was neglible during selection in parthenogenetic groups.

The direct response corresponded closely to prediction, but the correlated responses did not provide consistent qualitative fit.

Population structure studies of wild groups have traditionally been limited by a lack of accurate pedigree and historical information.  Current developments in both statistical and molecular pedigree reconstruction techniques now permit more detailed population structure studies of free-ranging populations than were previously possible.  Many of these techniques are used extensively in defining pedigree structures for captive populations, as the definition is a vital aspect of genetic management.  Captive colonies of nonhuman primates are managed for both maintenance of genetic variability and avoidance of inbreeding.  The close evolutionary relationship between humans and nonhuman primates makes these animals well suited as models for human disease.  Accordingly, nonhuman primates are being used in assessing the genetic components of complex phenotypes with increasing frequency.  Information that is learned from analyses of data from captive animals can be applied to wild populations and there is great potential for interplay between these research areas.

Twelve behavioral variables were measured in treated as well as saline-irrigated control animals placed in a novel environment. The genetic underpinnings and the genotype—treatment interactions with regard to these behaviors were analyzed in a classical Mendelian cross between the inbred strains C57BL/6 and DBA/2 and in a full 4 × 4 diallel cross, replicated five times, between these strains and strains C3H/St an CPB-K. Based on the hypothesis of an evolutionary history of directional selection for a well-balanced information-processing system, one might expect directional dominance for decrease in exploration after anosmization. Although decreases were found for several behavioral phenotypes, only few and relatively unimportant genotype—treatment interactions were present. This absence of any kind of genetic variation for behavioral change after anosmization points to an extremely strong directional selection which has eliminated all less favorable alleles. The findings support the hypothesis of directional selection for an efficient olfactory information-processing system.",few and relatively unimportant genotype-treatment interactions were present. Strong directional selection is therefore inferred. ,Mus musculus,mouse,Mammalia,"classic Mendelian cross between inbred strains, replicated five times",diallel,directional selection for an efficient olfactory information-processing system,probably not,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

QUANTITATIVE GENETIC   ANALYSIS OF CONDUCTION VELOCITY OF CAUDAL NERVES OF MOUSE, MUS MUSCULUS",3,1973,"Scores for body weight, tail length, and caudal nerve conduction velocity (assessed by direct, in vivo methods) from 1701 mice from the DBA/1J and C3H/HeJ inbred strains and their derived generations were employed for genetic analysis. Substantial strain differences were observed for the three characters, and hybrid scores exceeded those of inbreds. Within the reciprocal backcrosses, mating groups with inbred female parents had lower average scores for the three variables than did groups with hybrid female parents. The nature of this maternal influence is being examined. Heritability estimates from comparison of generation variances were high and not consistent. Those from generation means were lower, consistent, and in close agreement with estimates from regression of F3 offspring on their F2 parent scores. The heritability of conduction velocity in this population is apparently about 0.10. Regression estimates of heritability using 950 animals from an eight-way cross suggest that the heritability of caudal nerve conduction velocity in that population is about 0.20. From both populations, a slight positive genetic correlation among the characters is indicated.",not behavior,Mus musculus,mouse,Mammalia,scrosses between inbred lines,,not behavior,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not human

Change in activity and change in defecation from Day 1 to Day 2 were calculated for each individual, and resulting scores were subjected to genetic analysis. Strain comparisons and estimates of heritability revealed proportionately less genetic variance for change in activity than for either daily or total activity. In contrast, change in defecation was found to be as heritable as the other defecation measures. These results suggest that change in activity in novel situations may be of evolutionary significance.",less genetic variance for change in activity than daily or total activity and change in defecation was heritable - change in activity in novel situations may be of evolutionary significance,Mus musculus,mouse,Mammalia,"inbred strains and F1, backcross, F2, and F3 generations","inbred lines, F1, F1 backcross, F2, F3",probably not a super useful example,probably not,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,not human
